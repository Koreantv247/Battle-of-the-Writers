00:00:14,510 --> 00:00:15,480
What's wrong?

3
00:00:15,930 --> 00:00:17,280
I got dust in my eye.

4
00:00:17,750 --> 00:00:18,800
Don't rub.

5
00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:22,060
It really hurts.

6
00:00:23,620 --> 00:00:24,510
Stay still.

7
00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:39,440
I'll blow it out for you.

8
00:01:14,910 --> 00:01:16,260
Do you feel better?

9
00:01:19,730 --> 00:01:20,860
Yes.

10
00:01:26,620 --> 00:01:28,930
If just dust in your eye hurts this much,

11
00:01:29,660 --> 00:01:31,820
how would you become a demon lord?

12
00:01:31,820 --> 00:01:32,910
Hey!

13
00:01:35,930 --> 00:01:36,710
Hmph.

14
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:44,860
Are you mad?

15
00:01:47,020 --> 00:01:47,820
Shen An!

16
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:52,020
Why are you getting so close?

17
00:01:55,530 --> 00:01:57,660
I need to see if your eye is better now.

18
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:01,840
It is, you don't need to check.

19
00:02:07,730 --> 00:02:08,660
Why are you smiling?

20
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:14,000
Because your ears have turned red.

21
00:02:21,770 --> 00:02:22,570
Shen An...

22
00:02:34,730 --> 00:02:36,700
Has anyone ever told you...

23
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:45,120
that your eyes...

24
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:50,960
shine like stars?

36
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:13,620
Meeting time!

37
00:05:18,110 --> 00:05:31,110
#romance #reincarnation #entertainmentindustry #ABO #BL #historical #university

38
00:05:33,730 --> 00:05:36,659
These hashtags are trending amongst the Boys' Love novel.

39
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:38,710
Pick one, guys.

40
00:05:39,710 --> 00:05:41,350
There are too many.

41
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:46,130
Since we've decided to write a BL novel,

42
00:05:46,130 --> 00:05:48,530
let's choose some outstanding theme.

43
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:53,200
What do you think is the most important part of a BL novel?

44
00:05:54,860 --> 00:05:57,480
Of course it’s the love between two guys.

45
00:05:58,950 --> 00:06:02,400
That might be true, but isn't it about love regardless of gender?

46
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,350
Oh right, I didn't consider that.

47
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:07,640
We'll get better as we go.

48
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:13,370
Well, what is ABO?

49
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:17,200
Is it about blood type?

50
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:18,550
Hold on.

51
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:25,480
ABO is an omegaverse genre of BL novel.

52
00:06:27,910 --> 00:06:30,730
Let's start writing with what everyone is best at.

53
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:34,950
Sounds good.

54
00:06:35,510 --> 00:06:36,710
Let's begin!

55
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:44,620
As the saying goes,

56
00:06:44,620 --> 00:06:49,400
if there’s no boat, it’s hard to cross the river.

57
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:00,000
He is the leader of the Bu Zhou sect,

58
00:07:01,330 --> 00:07:03,280
respected by all.

59
00:07:05,350 --> 00:07:07,770
The Hong Meng sword technique he created…

60
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:11,880
is strong and indomitable.

61
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:26,040
But the current emperor is unwilling to acknowledge his power and fame.

62
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:30,080
Outwardly, it seems he allows him to serve the royal family,

63
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:33,680
but in fact, the emperor is wary of his every move.

64
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:36,440
So there is a constant power struggle within the court.

65
00:07:40,659 --> 00:07:42,240
Master Shen An.

66
00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:47,840
The Royal Observatory has observed the stars and predicted that…

67
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:54,440
“When Mars sets, calamity may follow.”

68
00:07:56,480 --> 00:08:00,840
The emperor has ordered you to lead all the sects

69
00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:04,840
to resolve this issue and prevent the disaster.

70
00:08:08,570 --> 00:08:10,550
Shen An accepts the royal decree.

71
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:14,840
Until one day,

72
00:08:16,510 --> 00:08:18,370
Shen An meets the other protagonist.

73
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:25,080
That calamity happens to be Duan Ru Xing.

74
00:08:34,950 --> 00:08:37,150
Don't you know who I am, Master Shen?

75
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:44,140
I am the demon you wish to destroy, the one you want to execute.

76
00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:52,380
Since then, Shen An feels like there’s something strange in his mind.

77
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:57,480
A piece of childhood love memories starts to resurface.

78
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:04,370
Shen An.

79
00:09:05,930 --> 00:09:07,060
What's wrong?

80
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:10,330
Nothing.

81
00:09:12,350 --> 00:09:15,940
Shen An, do you remember this ancient zither?

82
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:19,530
You gave it to me when I was 20.

83
00:09:22,350 --> 00:09:26,280
But it doesn’t feel like the person beside him was the one he’s longing for.

84
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:28,910
Is that so?

85
00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:49,330
Despite the divide between good and evil,

86
00:09:49,330 --> 00:09:52,260
Shen An and Duan Ru Xing work together to solve mysteries,

87
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:54,970
and find the demon, the real culprit destroying the human world.

88
00:09:57,350 --> 00:09:59,130
Are we at the cultivation stage?

89
00:09:59,130 --> 00:10:01,130
That's my specialty.

90
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:08,040
To defeat the demon, they need to train and cultivate together.

91
00:10:09,220 --> 00:10:13,730
Eventually, their bodies and souls become one.

92
00:10:15,370 --> 00:10:18,310
Their minds are connected, bringing them closer to the pinnacle.

93
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:21,660
How is it? Speechless?

94
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,080
My forte is sci-fi.

95
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:28,680
How do I write from the cultivation part to sci-fi?

96
00:10:33,510 --> 00:10:35,200
Oh, I got it.

97
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:38,970
I'll write about a mysterious group from the future,

98
00:10:38,970 --> 00:10:44,130
who wants revenge against Shen An and Duan Ru Xing.

99
00:10:49,460 --> 00:10:53,970
Shen An, Duan Ru Xing isn't like what you think.

100
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:58,730
When you were at Bu Zhou Valley, he risked his life to save you.

101
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:02,840
What are you saying? It was him?

102
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:07,800
But some people try to sow discord between Shen An and Duan Ru Xing.

103
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:10,770
Shen An, don't you know?

104
00:11:10,950 --> 00:11:14,800
The one who killed your master years ago was Duan Ru Xing.

105
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:17,170
He’s the true villain.

106
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:20,060
How could it be him?

107
00:11:21,730 --> 00:11:22,860
That’s right.

108
00:11:23,130 --> 00:11:26,600
The protagonists are actually characters in a novel.

109
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:30,400
To be precise, it's a plagiarized work.

110
00:11:30,950 --> 00:11:34,350
The demon is the copycat writer who is transported into this world.

111
00:11:34,350 --> 00:11:35,950
He’s skilled in various deadly techniques.

112
00:11:35,950 --> 00:11:39,260
He breaks the canon couples' dynamics, acts out of character,

113
00:11:39,260 --> 00:11:41,710
fixes bugs, alters the original storyline,

114
00:11:41,710 --> 00:11:44,170
and rewrites the protagonists’ fates.

115
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:50,600
In short, this demon ruins the original author's CP (couple pairing).

116
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:53,260
After pairing the male lead with a different character,

117
00:11:53,260 --> 00:11:57,130
he adds all the emotional scenes to this new character,

118
00:11:57,130 --> 00:12:00,460
and paints the original main character as a villain.

119
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:05,770
In the end, both the original author and the plagiarist are transported into the novel.

120
00:12:05,770 --> 00:12:10,280
The original author wants the protagonists to be together again,

121
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:13,910
but the plagiarist wants to keep breaking them apart.

122
00:12:13,910 --> 00:12:18,080
Exactly, the protagonists must fight the plagiarist,

123
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:22,330
and restore the original plot while falling in love.

124
00:12:22,330 --> 00:12:25,840
They’ll tackle various challenges together,

125
00:12:26,350 --> 00:12:28,930
blending themes of hot romantic tropes and martial arts.

126
00:12:28,930 --> 00:12:32,110
Plus, we'll throw in the transmigration plotline.

127
00:12:32,110 --> 00:12:35,800
We’ll also include love-hate relationships, memory loss, and possession.

128
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:38,570
And even address the hot issue of plagiarism.

129
00:12:38,570 --> 00:12:45,680
With the five of us specializing in martial arts, drama, mystery, cultivation, and sci-fi,

130
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:51,360
our BL novel will surely fascinate readers.

131
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:53,570
Fascinate?

132
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:55,880
The eyes of Wonder?

133
00:12:55,950 --> 00:12:58,260
That’s a great name, it’s perfect for us.

134
00:12:58,570 --> 00:13:02,440
So we have the main storyline, but will we write the content individually?

135
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:05,530
Are we going to discuss the details together?

136
00:13:05,530 --> 00:13:10,060
That wouldn’t be fun. We’ll just showcase our own talents.

137
00:13:10,060 --> 00:13:12,170
No word count limit.

138
00:13:12,170 --> 00:13:16,370
The first step is always the hardest. So who’s starting first?

139
00:13:24,260 --> 00:13:29,440
Since Shi Er Ye said he’s never had writer’s block, he should go first.

140
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:30,550
I agree.

141
00:13:30,570 --> 00:13:35,910
Let Shi Er Ye write the first chapter, and we’ll follow his style.

142
00:13:35,910 --> 00:13:39,880
I'll log in and publish the updates daily.

143
00:13:39,970 --> 00:13:40,970
Perfect.

144
00:13:52,910 --> 00:13:55,040
Is the great god that vengeful?

145
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,550
Just one poke, and he got me out of the meeting.

146
00:14:07,530 --> 00:14:11,880
I just saw your food post on Instagram. It looked really delicious.

147
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:13,880
Did you make it?

148
00:14:17,170 --> 00:14:18,170
Hello?

149
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:20,730
Uh...

150
00:14:21,550 --> 00:14:23,480
When you come back, I'll cook for you.

151
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:25,310
I guarantee it'll be tasty.

152
00:14:25,910 --> 00:14:28,800
Alright, you promised.

153
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:32,370
I can't wait to taste the cooking of chef Ob-aun.

154
00:14:34,570 --> 00:14:35,350
Hm.

155
00:14:50,930 --> 00:14:56,510
Little Prince, congratulations on moving into your new place.

156
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:06,950
Where did you two go just now?

157
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:11,460
Phone call.
The internet was down.

158
00:15:15,970 --> 00:15:20,130
We haven't thought of a book title yet because we were waiting for you guys.

159
00:15:21,710 --> 00:15:25,200
How about "The Villain's Strategy Guide"?

160
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:28,020
Good, what about the synopsis?

161
00:15:28,170 --> 00:15:31,020
I looked into some BL novels on the ranking,

162
00:15:31,020 --> 00:15:34,340
and found that they include the characteristics of the protagonists.

163
00:15:35,530 --> 00:15:41,320
A calm and collected male lead and a main character who's a cold swordmaster.

164
00:15:42,220 --> 00:15:48,460
I know just by looking at the title and summary that it’s going to be a hit.

165
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:52,530
Absolutely.

166
00:15:52,930 --> 00:15:53,800
Thumbs up.

167
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:54,930
Yay!

168
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,280
As of today, our group "The 5yes of Wonder"

169
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:03,640
has officially debuted in BL novel!

170
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:24,550
Check it out. Last night’s chapter was thrilling!

171
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:28,260
I was clutching my pillow.

172
00:16:28,260 --> 00:16:30,200
It was so fulfilling!

173
00:17:18,369 --> 00:17:19,910
Excuse me, boss.

174
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:22,510
Are you ordering? Wait a moment.

175
00:17:31,110 --> 00:17:33,040
You read this novel too?

176
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:35,480
Why? Do you read it as well?

177
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:37,370
Yes, my partner and I both read it.

178
00:17:37,370 --> 00:17:38,680
What do you think about it?

179
00:17:39,060 --> 00:17:42,600
Isn’t it so well written, especially today’s chapter?

180
00:17:45,620 --> 00:17:49,770
Which chapter? The male lead and the main character were supposed to meet today,

181
00:17:49,770 --> 00:17:54,170
but something happened to a side character, and the hero had to go help him.

182
00:17:54,170 --> 00:17:56,910
He even took off his cloak to cover that guy,

183
00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:00,310
held him in his arms, and fixed his hair!

184
00:18:00,310 --> 00:18:02,310
Bruh, what kind of writing is this?

185
00:18:04,970 --> 00:18:06,600
So, what do you want to order?

186
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:10,260
Never mind, I don’t want anything.

187
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:13,310
Eh, not anymore?

188
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,330
I completely agree. While fixing the hair was a cute detail,

189
00:18:25,330 --> 00:18:28,820
that scene gave me chills. It’s not serving.

190
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:30,800
If it gives you chills, then don't read it.

191
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:34,130
I thought it was fine, nothing cringe-worthy.

192
00:18:34,130 --> 00:18:39,420
When I read that the bottom was the most bewitching man on earth, I stopped reading.

193
00:18:39,420 --> 00:18:42,330
I haven’t seen such cheesy descriptions in a long time, lol.

194
00:18:42,330 --> 00:18:45,750
+1. I was eagerly waiting for the two to meet at first,

195
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:48,400
but then something illogical happened with a side character.

196
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:52,310
It feels like the writer is trying to add plot obstacles for the male lead and the main character.

197
00:18:52,350 --> 00:18:57,550
Writer, can you please give us a refreshing love story without a third wheel?

198
00:18:57,550 --> 00:19:00,930
This novel just launched. Do we need to judge it so harshly already?

199
00:19:00,930 --> 00:19:04,510
Finished reading. The male lead feels like a proud, overbearing leader.

200
00:19:05,350 --> 00:19:07,640
It’s P’Jao style? Which Jao? Jao Samut?

201
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:10,440
Don't pass the blame. Save P’Jao Samut please.

202
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:19,440
Hi, P’Jao Samut.

203
00:19:19,530 --> 00:19:20,220
Hey.

204
00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:28,730
Man, I wrote 10,171 characters describing an amazing fight scene.

205
00:19:28,730 --> 00:19:31,910
But in the end, readers only focus on the hair-fixing part

206
00:19:31,910 --> 00:19:35,660
in the scene where Shen An fights like lightning.

207
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:37,660
And you know what happened earlier?

208
00:19:38,130 --> 00:19:42,040
The crepe shop owner roasted me, so I didn’t buy anything.

209
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:45,640
How did you get out of that situation?

210
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:49,080
I told her I’m a reader, and I read it with my partner.

211
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:52,080
If I said I was a writer, I wouldn’t have made it out alive.

212
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:53,640
Hold on.

213
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:57,170
You wrote it yourself, and why did you even pretend to have a partner?

214
00:19:57,170 --> 00:20:00,040
Do you have one? No.

215
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:02,640
Haha, no partner.

216
00:20:03,530 --> 00:20:07,680
Sin, stop making fun of others.

217
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:10,660
I don’t have one now, but I’ll have one someday.

218
00:20:13,310 --> 00:20:15,010
Hey, can I ask you something?

219
00:20:15,260 --> 00:20:17,480
When the protagonists were about to meet,

220
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:23,480
why did you write about Shen An fixing Li Chuan’s hair? Isn’t that wrong pairing?

221
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:27,470
Actually, I had three drafts.

222
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:32,890
But I couldn't write about ambiguous male-male relationships.

223
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:35,660
So you made it obvious with the hair-fixing?

224
00:20:36,060 --> 00:20:36,990
Yes.

225
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:39,150
But how is it not ambiguous?

226
00:20:39,150 --> 00:20:44,060
Bro, how is hair-fixing ambiguous?

227
00:20:44,410 --> 00:20:46,060
Seriously, right, Ob-aun?

228
00:20:46,430 --> 00:20:53,130
So you wrote 10,171 characters and minor details for 3,422 characters…

229
00:20:54,220 --> 00:20:58,120
for them to finally meet, but there’s still a wall between them.

230
00:20:58,910 --> 00:21:01,930
I guess I’m the only one who can write the first meeting scene.

231
00:21:02,380 --> 00:21:04,270
Go ahead, bro.

232
00:21:04,970 --> 00:21:07,210
I believe in you.

233
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:09,770
You can do it.

234
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:13,880
I have a question about "The most bewitching man on earth”.

235
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:15,530
Is it really that cheesy?

236
00:21:16,220 --> 00:21:19,400
P’Jao Samut, are you still thinking about this?

237
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:24,220
One more thing, the readers are anticipating.

238
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:26,970
How should we write the first meeting scene?

239
00:21:30,250 --> 00:21:33,210
Or… should we ask Chan?

240
00:21:33,660 --> 00:21:34,960
Good idea.

241
00:21:37,550 --> 00:21:38,730
Ask him.

242
00:21:39,660 --> 00:21:42,990
Speak of the devil, he just texted me.

243
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:49,200
The sky here is so beautiful.

244
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:53,560
It’s on the way to work.

245
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:55,390
Whoa, it really is stunning.

246
00:21:55,390 --> 00:21:58,590
Yes, I’ve crossed many bridges, seen many clouds...

247
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:04,040
Hm?

248
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:07,710
Shan unsent the message.

249
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:15,290
Shi Er Ye, I need your help.

250
00:22:16,700 --> 00:22:18,160
What is it?

251
00:22:29,260 --> 00:22:30,460
Um.

252
00:22:31,150 --> 00:22:34,170
How should we write the first meeting between Shen An and Duan Ru Xing?

253
00:22:35,180 --> 00:22:38,510
Why can’t any of you figure it out?

254
00:22:39,530 --> 00:22:41,520
Well, we can’t think of anything.

255
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:43,520
Then don’t think.

256
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,350
How will we write it then?

257
00:22:46,830 --> 00:22:50,430
Their first meeting doesn’t have to be love at first sight.

258
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:54,670
No, I like love at first sight.

259
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:58,640
Besides, we’ve already set Shen An and Duan Ru Xing as a pair.

260
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:02,200
There must be some special feelings involved.

261
00:23:03,850 --> 00:23:05,290
Love at first sight, huh?

262
00:23:05,790 --> 00:23:07,420
Yes, I like it.

263
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:12,800
Mhm, I do too.

264
00:23:16,890 --> 00:23:19,800
I have to go, I have another meeting.

265
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:21,080
Um.

266
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:35,210
No, I like love at first sight.

267
00:23:35,210 --> 00:23:38,990
Besides, we’ve already set Shen An and Duan Ru Xing as a pair.

268
00:23:39,370 --> 00:23:42,240
There must be some special feelings involved.

269
00:23:42,540 --> 00:23:43,800
Mr. President.

270
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:45,370
Yes?

271
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:47,610
The guest you were expecting has arrived.

272
00:24:01,930 --> 00:24:02,940
Mr. Pie.

273
00:24:04,270 --> 00:24:05,480
I'll talk to you later.

274
00:24:06,140 --> 00:24:07,000
Okay.

275
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:09,340
What is it?

276
00:24:09,770 --> 00:24:11,640
Have you ever read this novel?

277
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:14,960
The Villain's Strategy Guide?

278
00:24:16,940 --> 00:24:18,520
I’m somewhat familiar with it,

279
00:24:19,630 --> 00:24:22,300
It’s quite popular.

280
00:24:22,540 --> 00:24:25,680
Yes, even though the 5yes of Wonder is a new writer,

281
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:27,680
they have a very unique style,

282
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:29,680
which made them famous overnight.

283
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:32,890
And the number of reads on our website is shockingly high.

284
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:36,970
I’ll contact this writer to discuss signing a contract with us.

285
00:24:38,730 --> 00:24:39,740
That’s great.

286
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:42,090
Go ahead.

287
00:24:42,830 --> 00:24:45,760
If you need anything, feel free to contact me.

288
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:47,310
Thank you, Mr. Pie.

289
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:48,360
Yes.

290
00:24:48,830 --> 00:24:49,790
But…

291
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:53,470
Is there anything else?

292
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:58,700
I feel like this novel is somehow familiar.

293
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:03,070
I first thought it might be another pen name of a certain writer,

294
00:25:03,310 --> 00:25:07,550
but after reading, I know it’s not the case because the writing style is too unique.

295
00:25:07,900 --> 00:25:09,440
So I’m even more unsure now.

296
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:15,360
Maybe I’m overthinking it.

297
00:25:16,250 --> 00:25:18,090
Well, I’ll take my leave now.

298
00:25:19,310 --> 00:25:20,090
Alright.

299
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:38,120
Guess my MBTI type.

300
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:40,510
Your MBTI?

301
00:25:42,060 --> 00:25:43,930
Is it CUTE?

302
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:55,180
You don’t like me, do you?

303
00:25:55,690 --> 00:25:57,500
No, I don’t like you.

304
00:25:58,910 --> 00:26:00,410
But I love you.

305
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:07,340
Let me see.

306
00:26:08,110 --> 00:26:09,840
Let me see it too.

307
00:26:10,030 --> 00:26:10,880
Can I post it?

308
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:12,250
Sure.

309
00:26:12,250 --> 00:26:13,520
Okay.

310
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:18,990
Okay.

311
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:21,180
Posted.

312
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:24,860
How have you been lately?

313
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:27,130
I’ve been fine.

314
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:29,470
Okay, let’s drink.

315
00:26:29,470 --> 00:26:31,470
You look like you’re made for each other.

316
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:37,560
And you’re in the Top 20 trending couples right now.

317
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:38,540
Really?

318
00:26:38,540 --> 00:26:39,420
Yes.

319
00:26:41,150 --> 00:26:43,210
That quickly? Let me check.

320
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:49,420
Wow, it’s true.

321
00:26:51,550 --> 00:26:52,810
That’s a lot.

322
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:01,630
Who’s calling my backup number?

323
00:27:05,660 --> 00:27:07,320
Let me take this call.

324
00:27:07,690 --> 00:27:08,720
Okay.

325
00:27:09,230 --> 00:27:10,280
I’ll wait here.

326
00:27:17,740 --> 00:27:18,600
Hello?

327
00:27:19,130 --> 00:27:22,440
Hello, is this the 5yes of Wonder?

328
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:24,750
I’m Yin, an editor from the YS literary website.

329
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:27,520
Hello.

330
00:27:29,710 --> 00:27:32,700
I’m reaching out to you about your work, The Villain's Strategy Guide.

331
00:27:32,700 --> 00:27:35,180
Your writing is excellent.

332
00:27:35,390 --> 00:27:39,000
Are you interested in joining our agency?

333
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:44,780
So, you’ll become a VIP writer,

334
00:27:44,780 --> 00:27:47,310
and get to be on the front page of the website,

335
00:27:47,470 --> 00:27:49,950
which will increase the visibility of your work.

336
00:27:52,780 --> 00:27:57,480
You’ll also have the opportunity to sell the rights for animation or film adaptations.

337
00:27:57,480 --> 00:28:01,200
I’ve sent more details via email.

338
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:04,540
Well, my regular job is quite busy.

339
00:28:04,540 --> 00:28:09,240
Writing novels is just a hobby for me. I think I’m okay for now.

340
00:28:10,380 --> 00:28:12,570
I’m really sorry.

341
00:28:12,970 --> 00:28:14,990
I understand.

342
00:28:15,210 --> 00:28:18,910
If you need any help, feel free to contact me anytime.

343
00:28:25,560 --> 00:28:26,510
Hello?

344
00:28:28,460 --> 00:28:29,520
Who’s that?

345
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:30,780
Oh, the demon king.

346
00:28:31,550 --> 00:28:34,620
Is that you, boss? What’s up?

347
00:28:35,580 --> 00:28:38,920
Have you read my comments? Have you finished the draft?

348
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:41,290
Have you made a copy of the draft?

349
00:28:43,370 --> 00:28:46,670
I’m busy. My work is more important than this.

350
00:28:47,610 --> 00:28:49,040
Are you taking on extra work?

351
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:50,220
No!

352
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:58,520
I went skating yesterday and fell. Now my bone is broken.

353
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:01,950
Does your wrist hurt?

354
00:29:04,090 --> 00:29:05,370
It’s my coccyx.

355
00:29:06,860 --> 00:29:08,590
Your hand is still usable then?

356
00:29:08,730 --> 00:29:11,690
You should spend less time in the nightclub.

357
00:29:12,890 --> 00:29:14,460
How do you know I’m at the nightclub?

358
00:29:20,170 --> 00:29:23,840
The deadline to revise your draft is tonight.

359
00:29:24,280 --> 00:29:28,970
Considering you can type 1,500 characters in an hour,

360
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:33,740
the chance of you finishing the draft today is 85%.

361
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:39,020
Hey, boss, do you see me as a servant or something?

362
00:29:39,020 --> 00:29:41,390
A servant is hurt and you’re this nonchalant?

363
00:29:42,250 --> 00:29:43,200
No.

364
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:47,080
If my servant returns injured, I’ll beat him to death.

365
00:29:53,550 --> 00:29:57,420
The 5yes of Wonder has become really famous!

366
00:29:57,640 --> 00:29:59,690
What a spectacular debut!

367
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:03,280
We even had an editor offering us a contract.

368
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:06,360
They called to offer the contract in the friendliest way.

369
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:07,550
Really?

370
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:09,040
Did you agree?

371
00:30:09,210 --> 00:30:11,500
No, I pretended to be a woman,

372
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:15,500
And said I was busy with my job, so I declined.

373
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:17,880
What?

374
00:30:18,540 --> 00:30:22,590
Otherwise, we would have been caught

375
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:27,050
Darn, why are the female editors so pretty and cute?

376
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:31,180
And then look at my male editor. Why is he so scary?

377
00:30:31,180 --> 00:30:33,180
He’s clearly a demon.

378
00:30:33,820 --> 00:30:36,080
Snap, I’ve captured it, Ozone.

379
00:30:37,130 --> 00:30:41,000
Lord Sin, are you hungry? Let me order delivery for you.

380
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:46,350
Good.
Or I can cook for you and send it over.

381
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:48,350
That’s fine.

382
00:30:57,180 --> 00:30:59,550
I like love at first sight too.

383
00:31:15,180 --> 00:31:16,600
Follow me.

384
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:22,520
Come on.

385
00:31:22,520 --> 00:31:24,990
Haha, you can’t catch me.

386
00:31:47,070 --> 00:31:48,190
Back already?

387
00:31:49,050 --> 00:31:51,920
Why did you come back today? You didn’t tell me beforehand.

388
00:31:54,330 --> 00:31:56,560
Have you eaten anything?

389
00:31:57,400 --> 00:31:58,190
Not yet.

390
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:01,050
Then I’ll cook something for you.

391
00:32:01,050 --> 00:32:01,790
Hey.

392
00:32:02,810 --> 00:32:04,250
But I haven’t prepared anything.

393
00:32:05,660 --> 00:32:07,600
It’s alright, I’m not hungry.

394
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:10,200
I should be home for a while this time.

395
00:32:10,490 --> 00:32:12,200
Let’s go shopping at the mall.

396
00:32:13,660 --> 00:32:16,000
Have you finished your work?

397
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:20,200
Yes, it’s all done. Let’s go shopping together.

398
00:32:21,900 --> 00:32:25,520
Hm, then I’ll just take a quick shower.

399
00:32:42,490 --> 00:32:44,270
Look, there’s a bear!

400
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:47,000
This is…

401
00:32:54,650 --> 00:32:55,580
So cute.

402
00:32:55,580 --> 00:32:57,600
Hey.

403
00:33:01,420 --> 00:33:02,190
Shan.

404
00:33:02,190 --> 00:33:07,500
Don’t be jealous. Both of you are invited to our love matching game.

405
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:10,270
The winner will get lots of rewards.

406
00:33:11,930 --> 00:33:13,040
Shall we?

407
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:18,590
Let’s go.

408
00:33:20,380 --> 00:33:21,320
Hurry up.

409
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:23,320
Is this a good idea?
Come on.

410
00:33:26,810 --> 00:33:31,080
Hi everyone, today we’ve prepared three games for you.

411
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:33,470
The first game is "Post-it Game."

412
00:33:33,470 --> 00:33:37,500
What is the Post-it Game? So, we’ll stick Post-its on your bodies,

413
00:33:37,500 --> 00:33:40,520
but you can’t use your hands to take them off.

414
00:33:40,520 --> 00:33:44,430
You can use anything but your hands within three seconds,

415
00:33:44,430 --> 00:33:46,350
and they must all be the same color.

416
00:33:46,350 --> 00:33:47,390
Are you ready?

417
00:33:47,690 --> 00:33:49,580
Family team VS Couple team.

418
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:53,290
Three, two, one, start!

419
00:34:09,710 --> 00:34:12,480
Oh, the Couple team won! Whoa.

420
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:13,880
The Family team almost made it.

421
00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:15,420
Congratulations to the Couple team.

422
00:34:15,420 --> 00:34:18,000
You won the first round.

423
00:34:20,540 --> 00:34:22,510
Great job to both teams.

424
00:34:22,510 --> 00:34:25,360
The second game is "Paper Folding."

425
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:29,050
In this game, you have only this space on the paper.

426
00:34:29,050 --> 00:34:32,989
If you don’t go outside this space, you win the second round.

427
00:34:32,989 --> 00:34:35,210
Ready?

428
00:34:35,210 --> 00:34:35,760
Yes.

429
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:40,440
If you’re ready, three, two, one, start!

430
00:34:55,260 --> 00:34:57,550
It’s over!

431
00:34:57,690 --> 00:34:59,360
The Family team won!

432
00:35:00,570 --> 00:35:02,590
How did the Couple team miss this?

433
00:35:04,970 --> 00:35:07,640
Don’t worry, it’s normal to win and lose in games.

434
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:09,920
The final game will decide it all.

435
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:12,890
Look at the prize. It’s really worth it.

436
00:35:12,890 --> 00:35:15,290
Don’t make a mistake on this game, I beg you.

437
00:35:15,290 --> 00:35:18,000
The final game is "Food Guessing."

438
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,760
This game, you have to tell us what the taste is like.

439
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:24,680
If you guess correctly within three tries, you win.

440
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:26,160
Team, get the equipment ready.

441
00:35:36,060 --> 00:35:37,400
Blindfolds?

442
00:35:38,140 --> 00:35:39,120
I…

443
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:42,620
Come on, let me help you put them on.

444
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:09,050
Bring the food in.

445
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:12,730
The blindfolds aren’t that scary.

446
00:36:17,930 --> 00:36:21,020
Whoever guesses the taste correctly first wins.

447
00:36:23,260 --> 00:36:24,350
Ready?

448
00:36:25,050 --> 00:36:27,130
Is everyone ready?

449
00:36:27,130 --> 00:36:31,480
Three, two, one, start!

450
00:36:34,190 --> 00:36:35,320
Can you smell it?

451
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:48,510
It’s matcha.

452
00:36:48,510 --> 00:36:50,720
Hey, did you guess matcha?

453
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:53,280
Oh, the Couple team is awesome.

454
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:56,400
The Couple team is the winner!

455
00:36:58,080 --> 00:36:59,880
Whoa, how did you know?

456
00:37:07,660 --> 00:37:11,240
Here are the prizes for you guys.

457
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:22,510
How cute.

458
00:37:26,970 --> 00:37:29,470
You guys are so cute, I’m getting jealous.

459
00:37:47,100 --> 00:37:50,090
How is it? Does it look good?

460
00:37:52,030 --> 00:37:53,360
It looks very tasty.

461
00:37:58,830 --> 00:37:59,870
Try this.

462
00:38:02,300 --> 00:38:03,320
Whoa.

463
00:38:05,950 --> 00:38:07,370
How are the comments?

464
00:38:08,540 --> 00:38:12,190
Seeing it makes me hungry. Did you make this yourself?

465
00:38:12,680 --> 00:38:16,990
He certainly ordered it and rearranged the plates. Shi Er Ye, you’ve changed.

466
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:23,560
Am I the only one who noticed someone else’s hand?

467
00:38:23,560 --> 00:38:28,560
So, posting a picture proves that you’re together,

468
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:33,770
that you’re a couple, and that you’re making your relationship public.

469
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:37,420
Who is the god Shi Er Ye eating with?

470
00:38:43,540 --> 00:38:44,270
Hey.

471
00:38:44,900 --> 00:38:46,430
What are you doing?

472
00:38:46,810 --> 00:38:49,220
I’m going to take a photo to show Ozone that I’m with you.

473
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:50,780
No way.

474
00:38:52,700 --> 00:38:53,780
Why not?

475
00:38:55,240 --> 00:38:59,000
Ozone asked me about renting a house earlier.

476
00:38:59,320 --> 00:39:01,920
I told him I found a rental house.

477
00:39:03,060 --> 00:39:04,160
But…

478
00:39:05,240 --> 00:39:07,160
I didn’t mention living with you.

479
00:39:07,820 --> 00:39:10,240
It’ll be a hassle if I tell Ozone.

480
00:39:11,460 --> 00:39:12,780
Alright, I won’t say anything.

481
00:39:20,620 --> 00:39:24,180
God Ye is truly amazing. I wonder who is the lucky person.

482
00:39:26,040 --> 00:39:29,680
Ozone is such a gossip. Good thing I didn’t tell him.

483
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:35,280
Come on, everyone. Let’s congratulate god Ye

484
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:39,340
and beg him to give out red envelopes.

485
00:39:40,060 --> 00:39:44,500
Congratulations, god Ye. I hope you have children soon.

486
00:39:45,360 --> 00:39:48,220
Congratulations, god Ye. May your love last a thousand years.

487
00:39:48,780 --> 00:39:53,700
We’re still missing one blessing, otherwise, no red envelopes.

488
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,000
Ob-aun, you’re the only one missing.

489
00:39:58,700 --> 00:40:00,600
You’re in on this too?

490
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:05,560
Aren’t you going to congratulate me?

491
00:40:08,700 --> 00:40:13,600
Ob-aun, hurry up! We’re waiting for the delivery red envelopes.

492
00:40:17,340 --> 00:40:18,720
Congrats.

493
00:40:26,220 --> 00:40:29,620
Wow, you’re giving us quite a lot. Thank you, boss.

494
00:40:30,540 --> 00:40:35,720
Thank you, great god Ye, for covering my milk tea expenses this month.

495
00:40:36,540 --> 00:40:40,320
It would be impolite to refuse. I wish you wealth and prosperity.

496
00:40:48,940 --> 00:40:53,300
If others know we are living together…

497
00:40:54,920 --> 00:40:57,320
they’ll think we’re a couple.

498
00:41:04,460 --> 00:41:06,480
Let’s eat.

499
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:21,920
Why do you cook so well?

500
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:29,180
When I worked in delivery, I learned how to cook in the kitchen.

501
00:41:32,580 --> 00:41:34,420
Oh, right.

502
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:36,880
About Lan Zhen, the character you just added…

503
00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:41,820
I like him so much. Have you written any details about this character?

504
00:41:43,120 --> 00:41:46,680
Not yet. I only have a rough character outline.

505
00:41:49,580 --> 00:41:51,640
Lan Zhen is very charming.

506
00:41:52,080 --> 00:41:55,420
We have many things to tell about him.

507
00:41:57,720 --> 00:42:02,220
From what I have planned, he has strong desires.

508
00:42:02,220 --> 00:42:04,960
He appears noble and divine,

509
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:09,880
but deep inside, he is still into worldly life.

510
00:42:14,840 --> 00:42:19,820
He must experience both sorrow and joy.

511
00:42:21,700 --> 00:42:24,700
Gain and loss.

512
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:50,280
You could give him a noble background.

513
00:42:50,280 --> 00:42:56,500
Create a sense of conflict with the opposites like the imperial court and divine beings.

514
00:43:00,060 --> 00:43:04,200
Hm, a noble genius with some flaws.

515
00:43:06,200 --> 00:43:09,000
People in the sect both love and hate him.

516
00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:14,600
For example, he rarely teaches students in the morning

517
00:43:25,320 --> 00:43:27,760
because he sleeps in and can’t get up.

518
00:43:29,400 --> 00:43:33,860
He has double standards, favors his own side, and is extremely biased.

519
00:43:35,260 --> 00:43:37,080
Not a care in the world.

520
00:43:39,060 --> 00:43:40,640
He’s very good-looking, though.

521
00:43:41,700 --> 00:43:44,940
And you could write about fellow disciples framing Duan Ru Xing.

522
00:43:58,440 --> 00:44:02,760
His soul has been destroyed. Don’t be afraid.

523
00:44:46,300 --> 00:44:51,760
Duan Ru Xing has long betrayed the sect and is now the villain they talk about.

524
00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:55,180
But Lan Zhen still treats him the same way as before.

525
00:44:55,180 --> 00:45:00,400
You evil spirits dare to forge the royal decree while I’m in meditation…

526
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:03,520
to destroy my disciple’s soul and attempt to take his life.

527
00:45:03,520 --> 00:45:06,240
He is an unlucky star, an evil demon.

528
00:45:06,240 --> 00:45:09,860
He is the disciple of I, Lan Zhen. How dare you challenge me.

529
00:45:25,800 --> 00:45:27,020
Master.

530
00:45:36,500 --> 00:45:41,080
Actually, I’m not good at writing scenes with Shen An and Duan Ru Xing.

531
00:45:42,120 --> 00:45:45,540
Adding Lan Zhen to the novel might make it easier to write.

532
00:45:49,480 --> 00:45:52,000
Oh no, I totally forgot.

533
00:45:52,440 --> 00:45:54,940
After Chapter 3, it’ll be my turn to write.

534
00:45:55,960 --> 00:45:59,620
I don’t know where the plot will be by then.

535
00:46:01,140 --> 00:46:03,460
Will Lan Zhen get a chance to reappear?

536
00:46:06,480 --> 00:46:07,540
It’s alright.

537
00:46:08,720 --> 00:46:11,040
We can add some additional scenes.

538
00:46:13,180 --> 00:46:16,140
Then I’ll leave Lan Zhen’s side story to you.

539
00:46:18,880 --> 00:46:19,740
Cool!

540
00:46:19,940 --> 00:46:24,860
So I’ll write the main outline, and you can fill in the details.

541
00:46:25,580 --> 00:46:27,920
This way, Lan Zhen will be like our child.

542
00:46:39,480 --> 00:46:40,620
Let me do it.

543
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:46,220
It’s okay, you already cooked for me.

544
00:46:46,700 --> 00:46:48,280
I’ll handle the rest.

545
00:46:58,320 --> 00:46:59,200
Hey.

546
00:47:02,040 --> 00:47:02,940
Come here.

547
00:47:05,780 --> 00:47:07,460
Your sleeves are going to get wet.

548
00:47:09,800 --> 00:47:12,960
You need to roll up your sleeves while washing dishes, you know?

549
00:47:14,780 --> 00:47:17,900
Or your sleeves will get soaked.

550
00:47:26,020 --> 00:47:31,480
You’re so dedicated, even when washing dishes, you still teach me how to write novels.

551
00:47:45,400 --> 00:47:48,420
Director
Nathawat Piyanonpong

552
00:47:48,660 --> 00:47:52,200
Who is cuter? Me or Lin Song Yue?

553
00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:54,440
Why are you asking about Lin Song Yue?

554
00:47:54,440 --> 00:47:59,460
You write as if he’s an angel. There must be a character prototype, right?

555
00:47:59,460 --> 00:48:05,280
Sleeping together before falling in love is also an interesting relationship.

556
00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:08,100
I think I can help you if you want to court someone.

557
00:48:08,100 --> 00:48:10,080
What should I do if I want to kiss someone?

558
00:48:10,080 --> 00:48:16,300
Suddenly, He Zhi couldn’t take it anymore. He slowly moved closer to Xu Yiming.
