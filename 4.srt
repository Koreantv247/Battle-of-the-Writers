2
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:16,340
Hey.

3
00:00:17,110 --> 00:00:20,600
I tried to find the way out but still ended up back here.

4
00:00:22,310 --> 00:00:24,140
Something’s off about this forest.

5
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:28,300
I think we might be in the legendary sacred area.

6
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:29,730
How do you know?

7
00:00:33,330 --> 00:00:36,440
Hey, don't you want to get out of here?

8
00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:44,160
This is an ideal land with just you and me.

9
00:00:45,460 --> 00:00:47,480
Why should I hurry to leave?

10
00:00:51,460 --> 00:00:53,490
But if you really want to get out of here...

11
00:00:56,260 --> 00:00:57,840
What are you going to do?

12
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:34,200
Pharinyakorn Khansawa
as Ob-aun.

13
00:01:35,110 --> 00:01:38,070
Koraphat Lamnoi

14

16
00:01:48,050 --> 00:01:50,580

17
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:54,620

Director
Nathawat Piyanonpong

22
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:38,420
Hey.

23
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:42,120
Come here.

24
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:47,000
Your sleeves are going to get wet.

25
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:52,640
You need to roll up your sleeves while washing dishes, you know?

26
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:57,600
Or your sleeves will get soaked.

27
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:12,550
I’m fine now.

28
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:18,880
Why are you stroking my hair?

29
00:03:40,579 --> 00:03:44,520
You... Why are you stroking my hair?

30
00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:55,500
Now that I've shown you this,

31
00:03:56,240 --> 00:04:00,370
have you figured out how to write the scene between Shen An and Duan Ru Xing yet?

32
00:04:02,690 --> 00:04:06,210
Oh, you’re so dedicated.

33
00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:10,300
Even when washing dishes, you still teach me how to write novels.

34
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:12,740
Thanks.

35
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:17,870
Let me finish washing the dishes.

36
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:36,000
Staying at home is such a bliss.

37
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:00,440
Why are you cleaning up now?

38
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:06,540
Huh? Am I making too much noise and bothering you?

39
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:07,190
No.

40
00:05:07,190 --> 00:05:07,980
What?

41
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:16,930
I said no.

42
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:21,240
So why are you cleaning up now?

43
00:05:21,570 --> 00:05:22,450
Oh.

44
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:24,790
I’m trying to digest the food.

45
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:28,560
Can I join you?

46
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:34,580
But I’m done vacuuming.

47
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:39,830
Oh, let’s do something else.

48
00:05:40,790 --> 00:05:41,510
Mhm.

49
00:07:16,210 --> 00:07:17,810
Do you like exercising?

50
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:20,190
Not really.

51
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:24,340
I couldn’t write, so I had to find something to do.

52
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:26,860
Just to change the mood.

53
00:07:30,140 --> 00:07:32,040
Is it "The Villain’s Strategy Guide"?

54
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:34,800
Yeah.

55
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:40,320
Actually, this story is meant to be an easy piece for us.

56
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:43,800
So don’t stress yourself out too much.

57
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:58,200
I'll help you.

58
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:03,500
Mhm.

59
00:08:31,140 --> 00:08:34,400
Duan Ru Xing, do you really know how to roast?

60
00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:40,520
Stop nagging me! You're making me nervous.

61
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:43,520
The lotus leaf's already torn.

62
00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:49,540
Then why are you using the lotus leaf?

63
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:59,780
Master Shen, you are not good with household chores, aren’t you?

64
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:06,440
Haven't you ever heard of lotus leaf-wrapped chicken?

65
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:13,240
You have to slice it into layers, coat it with mud, and roast it in the fire.

66
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:18,860
And it'll be fragrant, crispy on the outside, and tender on the inside.

67
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:22,040
Of course, I know.

68
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:25,900
But first of all, you didn't even remove the chicken's innards.

69
00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:32,120
Second, we’re at Corpse Mountain, and the mud here is all poisoned by the corpses.

70
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:38,040
Are you trying to poison me?

71
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:38,920
You!

72
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:44,320
If I wanted to kill you, why would I bother roasting chicken for you?

73
00:09:55,620 --> 00:09:57,180
I got an idea.

74
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:00,500
Your sword looks pretty sharp.

75
00:10:00,940 --> 00:10:04,480
Use it to cut the chicken into pieces, so it cooks faster.

76
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:07,660
Shen An, don't push your luck!

77
00:10:07,660 --> 00:10:10,900
You want me to use Hun Dun sword to cut chicken?

78
00:10:13,060 --> 00:10:15,580
Why don't you use your Hong Meng sword instead?

79
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:22,040
Are you going to do it or not?

80
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:27,400
If you don’t cut it, just forget about eating.

81
00:10:29,340 --> 00:10:30,980
Wait, where’s the chicken?

82
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:33,340
The chicken...

83
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:47,860
It’s all your fault! Now what?

84
00:10:47,860 --> 00:10:50,960
The chicken's gone, and the eggs are broken. We have nothing left.

85
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:53,760
What's wrong?

86
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:55,620
I got dust in my eye.

87
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,240
Don’t rub.

88
00:10:59,140 --> 00:11:00,280
It really hurts.

89
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:02,720
Stay still.

90
00:11:16,060 --> 00:11:17,580
I'll blow it out for you.

91
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:44,580
Do you feel better?

92
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:48,960
Yes.

93
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:57,100
If just dust in your eye hurts this much,

94
00:11:57,820 --> 00:11:59,800
how would you become a demon lord?

95
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:00,940
Hey!

96
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:04,800
Hmph.

97
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:13,260
Are you mad?

98
00:12:15,140 --> 00:12:16,080
Shen An!

99
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:20,080
Why are you getting so close?

100
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:25,860
I need to see if your eye is better now.

101
00:12:27,940 --> 00:12:29,920
It is, you don't need to check.

102
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:36,980
Why are you smiling?

103
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:42,200
Because your ears have turned red.

104
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:51,040
Shen An...

105
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:04,940
Has anyone ever told you...

106
00:13:11,670 --> 00:13:13,240
that your eyes...

107
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:19,040
shine like stars?

108
00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:33,060
The story is now at the point where Shen An is starting to question everything around him.

109
00:13:33,460 --> 00:13:36,380
He’s being cautious even with his friends

110
00:13:37,340 --> 00:13:40,130
and is paying special attention to Duan Ru Xing.

111
00:13:40,260 --> 00:13:42,920
There’s something ambiguous going on between them.

112
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:44,220
Huh.

113
00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:51,920
Sin probably wants Shen An and Duan Ru Xing to end up together,

114
00:13:52,460 --> 00:13:54,620
but I still have no idea how to write it.

115
00:13:55,140 --> 00:13:58,700
I’m having them face danger together in the forest,

116
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:01,360
but one chapter isn’t enough for that.

117
00:14:01,580 --> 00:14:06,440
And it’s tough to write a complete and drawn out scene in a short period.

118
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:10,400
Don’t worry about Sin.

119
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:14,400
You want them to overcome obstacles together, right?

120
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:16,780
I do.

121
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:37,640
Judging by the pacing of the novel, it’s definitely time for a climax.

122
00:14:39,580 --> 00:14:43,460
Try having them go through danger together, overcome some obstacles,

123
00:14:44,060 --> 00:14:46,040
discover some truth,

124
00:14:47,780 --> 00:14:50,700
and use that to deepen their feelings for each other.

125
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:56,100
I have some ideas,

126
00:14:57,720 --> 00:14:59,640
but I’m still a bit confused.

127
00:15:01,260 --> 00:15:05,580
Just write it first, then you can arrange it to be perfect later.

128
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:12,260
But I’m afraid that it won’t turn out well.

129
00:15:12,580 --> 00:15:18,220
It will. The Little Prince I know is the best storyteller in the world.

130
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:29,400
The outline still isn’t complete enough.

131
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:33,120
I really can’t write it in only one chapter.

132
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:35,660
Then write the parts you want to write,

133
00:15:36,140 --> 00:15:38,660
and I’ll take care of the rest.

134
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:41,680
Really?

135
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:44,080
Trust me.

136
00:15:51,220 --> 00:15:56,240
Then I’ll give you an idea for free.

137
00:15:57,420 --> 00:15:58,440
Stand up.

138
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:08,000
Have Duan Ru Xing ask Shen An what he is doing.

139
00:16:10,820 --> 00:16:13,160
'What are you doing?'

140
00:16:23,420 --> 00:16:24,840
'I found you.'

141
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:40,700
I found you.

142
00:17:23,180 --> 00:17:25,000
Ob-aun, you’ve changed.

143
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:26,380
What?

144
00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:30,500
The new chapter you uploaded today made me feel like I was being flirted with.

145
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:35,340
You're being dramatic.

146
00:17:35,340 --> 00:17:36,700
I’m not.

147
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:41,000
You write even more flirtatiously than Shan and Sin!

148
00:17:43,220 --> 00:17:46,100
And the comments are increasing every day.

149
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:52,020
You’re making it tough for me and P’Jao Samut. We can only observe carefully.

150
00:17:52,020 --> 00:17:54,720
Don’t drag me into this.

151
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:58,320
Don’t, Ozone.

152
00:18:15,940 --> 00:18:17,660
I found you.

153
00:18:27,380 --> 00:18:29,160
Why do I keep thinking about Shan?

154
00:18:29,420 --> 00:18:33,880
Then I’ll give you an idea for free.

155
00:18:34,060 --> 00:18:36,380
'What are you doing?'

156
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,600
I found you.

157
00:19:00,980 --> 00:19:03,500
Ahh, that’s embarrassing.

158
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:06,600
Shan, you idiot!

159
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:10,180
Why are you always distracting me?

160
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:18,680
Shan.

161
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:55,490
Why does this feel like married life?

162
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:18,060
Wow, a newlywed couple.

163
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:22,400
They are made for each other.

164
00:20:46,860 --> 00:20:49,430
Maybe I’ve been writing too many BL novels lately.

165
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:53,200
But if it’s Shan...

166
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:58,040
No, stop thinking about it.

167
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:03,260
Stop. Don’t think.

168
00:21:06,620 --> 00:21:07,960
Stop thinking about what?

169
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:10,560
You—When did you get here?

170
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:14,730
You weren't thinking about me, were you?

171
00:21:35,820 --> 00:21:38,240
No, no way.

172
00:21:43,660 --> 00:21:46,600
I’ve finished writing. Do you want to read it?

173
00:21:48,060 --> 00:21:49,220
Read what?

174
00:21:50,020 --> 00:21:51,880
The scene we talked about last time,

175
00:21:52,260 --> 00:21:55,230
The one where Shen An and Duan Ru Xing test the magic seal area.

176
00:21:55,300 --> 00:21:56,140
Oh.

177
00:21:56,840 --> 00:21:59,520
You go first, I’ll follow you.

178
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,080
Okay.

179
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:21,480
The scene we talked about earlier, can you adjust the first part?

180
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:26,060
I’ll organize the second part, and you can refine the overall story.

181
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:31,760
No, no, let’s stick with the original plan.

182
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:35,240
I want to read it in your style, it’s more surprising that way.

183
00:22:37,820 --> 00:22:39,100
You're exaggerating.

184
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:45,120
No.

185
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:48,360
I’m sincerely complimenting you.

186
00:22:59,020 --> 00:23:02,720
When we were in Chiang Mai, I wasn’t telling the truth.

187
00:23:05,140 --> 00:23:06,400
You mean?

188
00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:12,980
Have you read any of my works?

189
00:23:15,940 --> 00:23:17,440
I’ve never read your novels.

190
00:23:33,060 --> 00:23:36,700
Actually, I lied.

191
00:23:38,900 --> 00:23:40,460
I’ve read your novels.

192
00:23:41,580 --> 00:23:43,760
And I really like your writing.

193
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:50,140
Thank you.

194
00:23:59,460 --> 00:24:01,080
My legs are sore.

195
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:07,340
I’m not talented at writing novels.

196
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:09,460
I just really like doing it.

197
00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:16,100
Compared to Ozone, Sin, P’Jao Samut, or you,

198
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:18,560
I don’t measure up at all.

199
00:24:19,540 --> 00:24:21,880
What I’m good at is telling stories.

200
00:24:22,340 --> 00:24:26,580
No matter how dull a joke is, I try to make it fun.

201
00:24:29,940 --> 00:24:31,660
I’m really not talented.

202
00:24:39,340 --> 00:24:44,220
But if you do what you love, you might become talented at it.

203
00:24:56,860 --> 00:24:58,560
Why are you staring at me like that?

204
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:00,860
Because you're handsome.

205
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:05,660
And you’re cute.

206
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:29,760
Why are we complimenting each other like this?

207
00:25:37,940 --> 00:25:42,780
Can I ask a question that might be hard to answer?

208
00:25:46,460 --> 00:25:50,060
Who is cuter? Me or Lin Song Yue?

209
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:52,780
You’re both cute.

210
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:55,780
Why’d you suddenly bring up Lin Song Yue?

211
00:25:56,660 --> 00:25:58,160
You like him?

212
00:25:58,160 --> 00:26:01,180
I should be the one asking that. Do you like him?

213
00:26:01,700 --> 00:26:05,440
You write as if he’s an angel who doesn’t really exist.

214
00:26:07,380 --> 00:26:10,830
There is real-life inspiration for this character, right?

215
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:28,020
Well…

216
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:31,660
What smells so good?

217
00:26:33,860 --> 00:26:37,780
The food should be ready. Let’s go eat and chat.

218
00:26:43,260 --> 00:26:44,160
Come on.

219
00:26:51,060 --> 00:26:53,780
Akin brought these mushrooms from Yunnan.

220
00:26:54,420 --> 00:26:57,950
He said they help nourish the blood and strengthen the body.

221
00:26:58,560 --> 00:27:01,450
Which is perfect for people like us who work all night.

222
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:43,360
Are you okay?

223
00:27:48,220 --> 00:27:50,280
When you mentioned staying up late,

224
00:27:51,340 --> 00:27:56,760
I think being a writer is quite a lonely job.

225
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:02,740
We stay up late in exchange for a compliment.

226
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:09,540
You know,

227
00:28:10,420 --> 00:28:15,640
that day when I said the Little Prince I know is the best storyteller in the world,

228
00:28:16,220 --> 00:28:20,600
I wasn’t trying to flatter you. I really meant it.

229
00:28:26,660 --> 00:28:28,640
Okay, I believe you.

230
00:28:31,460 --> 00:28:33,500
But don’t you think it’s strange?

231
00:28:35,220 --> 00:28:36,440
What’s strange?

232
00:28:36,740 --> 00:28:39,080
Just now, when you mentioned Lin Song Yue,

233
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:43,880
It made me think about how similar our ideas were.

234
00:28:45,580 --> 00:28:50,840
The weird part was that, in your story, the little fox tells the little hedgehog a story.

235
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:55,720
In mine, it’s the little hedgehog who tells the little fox a story.

236
00:28:56,860 --> 00:28:58,180
What a coincidence, right?

237
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:01,300
That one?

238
00:29:02,900 --> 00:29:04,860
Once upon a time,

239
00:29:07,060 --> 00:29:09,620
there was a little hedgehog living in the forest.

240
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:17,680
Its best friend is a little squirrel.

241
00:29:20,260 --> 00:29:25,340
One day, the little squirrel moved away.

242
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:31,040
The little hedgehog was so sad,

243
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:33,420
so it wrote a letter to the little squirrel.

244
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:40,080
The little hedgehog sent the little squirrel a letter, but wrote the address wrong,

245
00:29:41,020 --> 00:29:46,700
so the letter was sent to the little fox’s house instead.

246
00:29:57,660 --> 00:29:58,800
Little hedgehog.

247
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:02,380
Don’t you think there’s something wrong?

248
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:05,660
What did you just call me?

249
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:10,460
Hey!

250
00:30:15,660 --> 00:30:18,090
Watch out, there are humans ahead!

251
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:21,490
It’s dangerous! Danger alert!

252
00:30:22,090 --> 00:30:23,660
No, they’re not humans.

253
00:30:23,660 --> 00:30:26,960
Aren’t they the little hedgehog and little fox?

254
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:29,740
Are these mushrooms poisonous?

255
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:34,060
Don’t you feel cold?

256
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:41,520
Hey, look over there, the roof’s leaking!

257
00:30:41,540 --> 00:30:44,300
It’s snowing. Have you ever seen snow?

258
00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:48,980
Where are you going?

259
00:30:48,980 --> 00:30:50,620
I’m going to find the little squirrel.

260
00:30:50,620 --> 00:30:53,680
It’s snowing, so winter is coming.

261
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:56,720
I need to hurry and tell the little squirrel to move into hibernation.

262
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:01,900
I’ll go with you!

263
00:31:01,900 --> 00:31:03,400
Follow me!

264
00:31:08,260 --> 00:31:10,280
Did you find it?
No.

265
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:19,300
You need to search over there.

266
00:31:20,100 --> 00:31:21,080
Okay.

267
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:30,880
Hey.

268
00:31:31,300 --> 00:31:35,440
The little squirrel is outside. We need to find it quickly, or it’ll freeze to death!

269
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:37,840
Black Dog!

270
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:39,420
Hey, come here!

271
00:31:41,340 --> 00:31:42,400
Hurry up!

272
00:31:42,660 --> 00:31:44,000
Black Dog, my good boy.

273
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:47,700
Hold on tight. Black Dog is as fast as lightning.

274
00:31:47,900 --> 00:31:49,160
Let’s go, Black Dog!

275
00:31:55,960 --> 00:32:00,220
Black Dog, why are you so stubborn?

276
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:04,500
Is this really going to work?

277
00:32:06,940 --> 00:32:08,980
Looks like we’ll have to find it ourselves.

278
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:10,080
Come on.

279
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:11,100
Black Dog.

280
00:32:11,100 --> 00:32:12,400
Follow me.

281
00:32:12,900 --> 00:32:18,760
Hey, if we take this bus, we’ll reach the little squirrel’s house faster.

282
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:26,740
No, the little squirrel’s house is too far. We can’t get there by bus.

283
00:32:27,380 --> 00:32:34,000
What should we do then? Tell me how we should go.

284
00:32:36,340 --> 00:32:38,400
We have to swim there.

285
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:40,040
Swim?

286
00:32:41,940 --> 00:32:43,780
Wait for me.

287
00:32:43,780 --> 00:32:45,220
Follow me.

288
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:50,000
One stroke at a time.

289
00:32:55,280 --> 00:32:56,360
What?

290
00:32:56,360 --> 00:32:57,500
Haha.

291
00:32:58,940 --> 00:33:01,060
There, let’s go!

292
00:33:01,060 --> 00:33:03,840
Go ahead. Go!

293
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:15,700
What’s wrong?

294
00:33:18,500 --> 00:33:19,460
Come on.

295
00:33:20,940 --> 00:33:22,180
Let me help you.

296
00:33:28,660 --> 00:33:30,200
Come on, little hedgehog.

297
00:33:34,660 --> 00:33:37,820
Are you really going in there?

298
00:33:38,980 --> 00:33:41,720
You are the one who told me to scatter the seeds,

299
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:47,720
let them grow into a big tree, so the little squirrel will come back to me.

300
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:54,460
But it’s too cold now.

301
00:33:57,520 --> 00:34:00,080
Believe in little hedgehog, follow me.

302
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:01,120
Come here.

303
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:02,160
Fine.

304
00:34:10,300 --> 00:34:11,699
Right here.

305
00:34:26,420 --> 00:34:29,920
I have two more. The little squirrel will come back to me for sure.

306
00:34:45,260 --> 00:34:47,780
These are just rocks.

307
00:35:54,860 --> 00:35:55,700
Hey?

308
00:36:14,620 --> 00:36:15,420
Hello?

309
00:36:15,420 --> 00:36:19,360
Shan, did you get the mushrooms my assistant sent you?

310
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:23,620
Don’t eat the one with brown caps.

311
00:36:23,620 --> 00:36:26,360
Or else you’ll start seeing an illusion that people shrink.

312
00:36:27,420 --> 00:36:28,340
No.

313
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:29,940
What?

314
00:36:31,020 --> 00:36:32,540
I didn’t see people shrink.

315
00:36:34,060 --> 00:36:35,500
That’s a relief.

316
00:36:36,080 --> 00:36:37,500
But I did see a hedgehog.

317
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:39,240
Huh?

318
00:36:40,860 --> 00:36:43,040
Did you really eat it!?

319
00:36:44,020 --> 00:36:46,240
Should I call a doctor, Shan?

320
00:36:46,900 --> 00:36:47,820
Shan?

321
00:37:28,830 --> 00:37:32,870
I’m going out for work. You’re sleeping soundly, so I don’t want to wake you.

322
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:37,030
I enjoyed our conversation yesterday, so I prepared you a gift.

323
00:37:37,030 --> 00:37:40,500
For Little Prince, the best storyteller in the world.

324
00:37:41,080 --> 00:37:42,280
A gift?

325
00:37:46,300 --> 00:37:47,020
Huh?

326
00:37:47,700 --> 00:37:49,560
5,137 notifications?

327
00:37:52,340 --> 00:37:54,340
Did I get banned by the fans again?

328
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:58,380
Shi Er Ye sent me a message?

329
00:37:59,170 --> 00:38:00,470
It's like something out of a dream.

330
00:38:00,470 --> 00:38:03,660
What? An A4 length comment?

331
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:10,800
I need to hurry and tell the little squirrel to move into hibernation.

332
00:38:11,260 --> 00:38:12,320
Did you find it?

333
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:16,300
The little squirrel is outside. We need to find it quickly, or it’ll freeze to death!

334
00:38:16,300 --> 00:38:17,340
Hold on tight.

335
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:24,740
Right here.

336
00:38:46,900 --> 00:38:49,230
After finishing reading “Fiery Attire”,

337
00:38:49,230 --> 00:38:52,200
I could really feel the author’s dedication.

338
00:38:52,230 --> 00:38:56,530
Crafting a beautifully written story is no simple task.

339
00:38:56,700 --> 00:39:03,600
The characters were well-developed, and their backstories were seamlessly integrated into the story.

340
00:39:03,930 --> 00:39:09,200
Even though the language is written in a martial arts style, it is easy to read.

341
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:15,000
The vocabulary was carefully chosen, and references were always provided for readers.

342
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:23,960
Am I seeing things, guys?

343
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:30,960
My idol, Shi Er Ye, just left a ten-thousand-word comment on Little Prince’s Fiery Attire!

344
00:39:31,330 --> 00:39:36,030
Did the editor make him do it? Like getting paid to review?

345
00:39:36,270 --> 00:39:40,830
If I remember correctly, Fiery Attire was a problematic work back then.

346
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:44,470
I read it, and Master Shi Er Ye’s review was super detailed.

347
00:39:44,470 --> 00:39:48,600
As a hardcore fan of Little Prince, I can’t compare him!

348
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:54,430
How is he so meticulous? Master Shi Er Ye analyzed everything,

349
00:39:54,430 --> 00:40:01,200
from the words, sentences, writing style, the pacing, and even the characters and the plot.

350
00:40:01,230 --> 00:40:05,230
He praised everything that deserved praise, but it was all based on reality.

351
00:40:05,230 --> 00:40:09,130
It’s a genuine and sensible compliment. How admirable.

352
00:40:10,300 --> 00:40:15,900
Netizens accused Fiery Attire of plagiarism from Shi Er Ye's work.

353
00:40:16,100 --> 00:40:20,530
But now, Shi Er Ye goes and writes a ten-thousand-word comment on it.

354
00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:27,800
What the heck? Why am I blushing reading Shi Er Ye’s comment?

355
00:40:35,300 --> 00:40:39,380
Thank you so much, Master Shi Er Ye.

356
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:53,260
Master Shi Er Ye praised me so much, I’m blushing here.

357
00:40:53,960 --> 00:40:56,440
I just wanted to praise you in front of everyone.

358
00:41:17,340 --> 00:41:19,340
Thank you.

359
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:35,420
Master Shi Er Ye! Great god Ye!

360
00:41:35,420 --> 00:41:40,720
Please leave a comment on my recently finished “Feng Bai Chronicles”, please, please?

361
00:41:42,300 --> 00:41:48,920
Master Shi Er Ye, my story “Flowing Time” that ended half a year ago needs your comment too, please!

362
00:41:50,780 --> 00:41:52,920
Master Ye, please comment for me!

363
00:41:52,920 --> 00:41:55,060
Ozone! I’m the first in line!

364
00:41:57,140 --> 00:42:01,420
No more long comments, I’ll only give short ones. Take it or leave it.

365
00:42:01,420 --> 00:42:03,220
I'll take it!
Yes, please.

366
00:42:05,660 --> 00:42:09,180
Here comes the talk of the town. Pass me the mic.

367
00:42:09,180 --> 00:42:10,880
Little Prince.

368
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:17,080
How do you feel about Master Shan’s ten-thousand-word comment on your work?

369
00:42:19,220 --> 00:42:22,040
I’m quite touched.

370
00:42:22,680 --> 00:42:24,080
Just touched?

371
00:42:24,080 --> 00:42:29,460
Why don’t you take a bath, put on some nice clothes, and please him?

372
00:42:30,900 --> 00:42:33,800
Since Shan is being this obvious.

373
00:42:33,800 --> 00:42:38,040
I bet you’re going to end up in the “Writer’s Fan Club” page for sure.

374
00:42:38,300 --> 00:42:39,460
I’m not sure about that.

375
00:42:39,460 --> 00:42:41,260
I’m sure you will!

376
00:42:41,260 --> 00:42:47,680
There are pictures of Ob-aun and Master Shi Er Ye on Instagram now.

377
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:48,720
Where?

378
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:51,580
You want to see it? I’m gonna send them to you guys.

379
00:42:56,540 --> 00:43:01,300
When it comes to Instagram gossip, you should’ve heard about the “Writer’s Fan Club” account.

380
00:43:01,300 --> 00:43:02,560
Everyone knows it.

381
00:43:02,560 --> 00:43:05,120
This account started the whole hype…

382
00:43:05,120 --> 00:43:07,120
About those photos describing a relationship…

383
00:43:07,120 --> 00:43:11,700
from enemies to lovers between Shi Er Ye and Little Prince.

384
00:43:11,700 --> 00:43:14,160
Please have a look at the photos.

385
00:43:27,170 --> 00:43:30,600
Ob-aun was accused of plagiarism by Shan.

386
00:43:32,070 --> 00:43:34,970
He confronted Shan with anger

387
00:44:06,570 --> 00:44:08,800
and sorrow.

388
00:44:10,980 --> 00:44:15,140
Wow, this scene is so detailed like I’m watching it with my own eyes!

389
00:44:15,140 --> 00:44:20,830
The description is so vivid, as if filming with a 360-degree drone!

390
00:44:25,260 --> 00:44:28,570
Hey, Shi Er Ye and I are still in this group.

391
00:44:29,900 --> 00:44:33,140
It’s kind of fun shipping them right in front of their faces.

392
00:44:34,300 --> 00:44:37,480
Don’t get ahead of yourself, Ob-aun. It isn’t over yet.

393
00:44:37,740 --> 00:44:40,340
This part is gold.

394
00:45:07,770 --> 00:45:11,530
At this moment, Ob-aun feels a sense of relief.

395
00:45:11,530 --> 00:45:16,070
Both he and Shi Er Ye have now let go of everything.

396
00:45:20,140 --> 00:45:22,780
Hahaha, even God Ye had to give in.

397
00:45:23,940 --> 00:45:27,520
Are you turning this martial arts story into a drama?

398
00:45:28,040 --> 00:45:29,520
Hahaha.

399
00:45:30,060 --> 00:45:34,140
Ozone, keep reading the comments, and screenshot them for us.

400
00:45:34,140 --> 00:45:38,700
Yes, sir! I’ll screenshot them for you all.

401
00:46:15,470 --> 00:46:22,330
I'm a fan of Shi Er Ye. He’s usually very aloof. Check his Instagram and you'll see.

402
00:46:22,330 --> 00:46:28,070
He never posts about his daily life, never interacts with other writers, and doesn’t respond to reader comments.

403
00:46:28,070 --> 00:46:32,900
But recently, he posted three times on Instagram, two of them were about Little Prince.

404
00:46:32,900 --> 00:46:36,330
He even took the time to reply to comments about Little Prince.

405
00:46:36,330 --> 00:46:42,130
He’s just… Anyway, our fandom is in complete shock.

406
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:46,970
OMG! This is too sweet!

407
00:46:49,870 --> 00:46:53,570
It’s time to reveal something big.

408
00:46:53,600 --> 00:46:55,230
What is it?

409
00:46:55,230 --> 00:46:59,700
Ladies and gentlemen, it’s time to write the sex scene!

410
00:47:02,070 --> 00:47:04,670
Whoa, how did we get to that scene so fast?

411
00:47:22,670 --> 00:47:25,230
Director
Nathawat Piyanonpong

412
00:47:25,670 --> 00:47:29,570
Who's gonna write it first?

413
00:47:29,570 --> 00:47:32,030
Let's be fair and draw lots.

414
00:47:32,030 --> 00:47:36,070
I'm feeling unwell, so I'll have to postpone uploading the novel today.

415
00:47:36,070 --> 00:47:39,370
Excuse me. We have two people. Can we switch seats with you?

416
00:47:41,070 --> 00:47:43,330
Weren't you supposed to be in the hospital?

417
00:47:43,330 --> 00:47:46,370
This is shrimp, your favorite.

418
00:47:46,970 --> 00:47:48,530
Why did you choose shrimp?

419
00:47:48,530 --> 00:47:50,600
Because my special one loves it.

420
00:47:50,600 --> 00:47:54,200
Stop laughing. I said stop.

421
00:47:54,200 --> 00:47:57,570
Suddenly, He Zhi couldn’t take it anymore.

422
00:47:57,600 --> 00:48:00,170
He slowly moved closer to Xu Yiming,
