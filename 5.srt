Director
Nathawat Piyanonpong

12
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:20,460
It’s time to reveal something big.

13
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:22,230
What is it?

14
00:01:22,330 --> 00:01:26,800
Ladies and gentlemen, it's time to write the sex scene!

15
00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:31,900
Whoa, how did we get to that scene so fast?

16
00:02:56,829 --> 00:03:00,930
What an interesting wedding night.

17
00:03:01,430 --> 00:03:07,900
The blazing fire reflects the deep desires that lie within.

18
00:03:21,860 --> 00:03:25,630
If you want to put a stop to these desires,

19
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:29,400
both of you will have to...

20
00:03:51,829 --> 00:03:55,660
This drink... you've been drugged.

21
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:05,060
Dang! Duan Duan is so h*rny!
And Shen has a pretty good figure. Are they gonna do it?
Their flirty talk is so addictive I can’t stop reading! Ahhh, just get on with it already!

22
00:04:05,130 --> 00:04:07,430
These are the recent readers’ comments.

23
00:04:07,430 --> 00:04:12,760
Did you see that last one from "Little Docile Bunny"?

24
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:18,959
They’ve been with us since the first chapter, so it’s time to return the favor to our loyal fan.

25
00:04:20,529 --> 00:04:24,200
But aren’t Shen An and Duan Ru Xing…

26
00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:30,860
only at the stage of forehead kissing?

27
00:04:31,030 --> 00:04:36,659
Their progress was fast enough for me.

28
00:04:39,130 --> 00:04:47,860
Well, I think sleeping together before falling in love is an interesting dynamic.

29
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:51,130
Make love, then fall in love.

30
00:04:54,330 --> 00:04:57,130
So, today’s meeting agenda is …

31
00:04:57,560 --> 00:05:01,700
who’s going to write the first intimate scene?

32
00:05:03,630 --> 00:05:05,900
Don’t we usually take turns?

33
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:07,800
This is not for me.

34
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:12,800
The first time is important because we gotta lay the foundation.

35
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:17,630
If it’s all filler like Sin’s writing, dragging it out will surely kill the mood.

36
00:05:17,730 --> 00:05:19,230
Hey, Ozone!

37
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:26,630
But you have a point, we’ve been writing Shen An and Duan Ru Xing for so long that I grew attached.

38
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:31,830
Duan Ru Xing’s really pitiful.

39
00:05:32,130 --> 00:05:35,960
So their first time has to be great.

40
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:43,860
Yeah, I’m nervous.

41
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:51,360
Let's be fair and draw lots.

42
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:54,430
I’ll write the lots.

43
00:05:54,700 --> 00:05:55,760
Alright.

44
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:59,300
Okay, let’s do it.

45
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:02,530
Shi Er Ye, are you here? I’m gonna start.

46
00:06:02,530 --> 00:06:03,900
I’m here.

47
00:06:10,430 --> 00:06:14,160
Who wants the first lot?

48
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:17,630
I’ll take it.

49
00:06:17,630 --> 00:06:19,430
Let’s see, P’Jao Samut.

50
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:30,730
P’Jao Samut, you’re safe!

51
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:34,000
Who’s next?

52
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:37,700
I’d say, God Ye.

53
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:41,800
Alright, Sin. This one is yours, God Ye.

54
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:54,130
Shi Er Ye is the lucky winner!

55
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:02,660
I’m safe. It's best to have Shi Er Ye write it.

56
00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:06,730
These two characters are in your hands, God Ye.

57
00:07:08,730 --> 00:07:11,000
Mommy number one is here.

58
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:16,700
Shi Er Ye, please don’t make Duan Ru Xing suffer too much.

59
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:19,660
Don’t make it too torturous for him, please.

60
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:22,930
That’s mommy number two.

61
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:28,700
Wait, I was in a meeting, what were you talking about?

62
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:31,760
What do I have to write?

63
00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:42,159
Congratulations, Shi Er Ye, you’ll be the one to write the intimate scene.

64
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:04,360
Hello.

65
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:08,000
You didn’t even give me a heads-up just now.

66
00:08:09,530 --> 00:08:12,800
About the intimate scene?

67
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:18,660
You want to see me write it too, don’t you?

68
00:08:18,860 --> 00:08:20,500
No, no.

69
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:24,900
Mr. President, could you please take a look at this document?

70
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:26,800
Leave it here.

71
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:32,460
Are you busy?

72
00:08:33,230 --> 00:08:36,630
A little bit. I should be back next week.

73
00:08:37,730 --> 00:08:39,200
Great.

74
00:08:39,460 --> 00:08:44,660
Ob-aun, I bought the fruit you like and put it in the fridge.

75
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:50,930
I was worried you’d be too busy with writing to cook.

76
00:08:50,930 --> 00:08:52,300
Whoa.

77
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:56,830
So I bought some ready-to-eat meals too. They’re also in the fridge.

78
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:01,600
And I watered the flowers already.

79
00:09:04,730 --> 00:09:05,700
Hm.

80
00:09:08,230 --> 00:09:14,800
I also prepared some aroma bath products for you in my bathroom.

81
00:09:15,430 --> 00:09:19,460
You can use them to boost your productivity.

82
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:22,200
You really know how to take care of people.

83
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:24,260
Isn’t it good?

84
00:09:24,260 --> 00:09:30,660
It is. Before you were around, I managed just fine.

85
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:36,000
But now I’m starting to worry I won’t get used to being alone.

86
00:09:36,530 --> 00:09:38,960
I want you to come back soon.

87
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:42,360
I have no one to share meals with or watch movies with.

88
00:09:44,260 --> 00:09:46,600
Mr. President, the meeting is about to start.

89
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:49,460
You should get back to work.

90
00:09:50,260 --> 00:09:54,000
Alright, I’ll call you when I’m done.

91
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:57,330
Hm, bye-bye.

92
00:09:57,330 --> 00:09:59,330
Bye-bye.

93
00:10:13,930 --> 00:10:18,960
I never realized how quiet the house could be without Shan.

94
00:11:06,860 --> 00:11:10,030
I wonder what kind of story Shan is planning to write.

95
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:13,760
When is Shen An going to take off Duan Ru Xing’s wedding dress?

96
00:11:15,330 --> 00:11:21,400
They’ve already cultivated together, so why are they still wearing wedding clothes?

97
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:27,230
Why don't we let them enter the marriage chamber already?

98
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:34,000
I feel like our chat has the energy of parents whose daughter's getting married.

99
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,900
Pretty much, we’re like his moms in a way.

100
00:11:39,330 --> 00:11:44,430
Actually, when Duan Ru Xing started acting frisky, Shen An could’ve just left,

101
00:11:44,430 --> 00:11:46,430
but he didn’t …

102
00:11:47,430 --> 00:11:48,800
So juicy.

103
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:49,960
Yeah.

104
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:53,060
Wait, isn't Shan going to write it?

105
00:11:53,060 --> 00:11:59,300
Most of Shi Er Ye’s novels are mysteries. He’s never written something like this.

106
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:01,560
I’m looking forward to it.

107
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:11,100
What are you guys talking about?

108
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:17,860
We’re wondering about how you’re gonna write the intimate scene.

109
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:41,200
I'm coming back tomorrow.

110
00:12:44,330 --> 00:12:47,360
You want to start writing that soon?

111
00:12:55,030 --> 00:12:57,400
Shan isn’t texting back. Is he mad?

112
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:11,700
Hello, Shan.

113
00:13:12,430 --> 00:13:13,830
What are you doing?

114
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:18,530
I’m eating the fruit you prepared for me. It’s really sweet.

115
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:22,630
When you come back, I’ll make something delicious for you.

116
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:27,360
Okay, see you tomorrow.

117
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:31,500
Bye-bye.

118
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:53,030
Smart speaker.

119
00:13:53,030 --> 00:13:56,130
Hello, how can I help you?

120
00:13:57,430 --> 00:13:58,800
I wanna know …

121
00:13:59,830 --> 00:14:03,830
What determines the relationship between two people?

122
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:07,860
I don’t understand. Could you ask the question again?

123
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:14,930
I’ve just met Shan,

124
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:20,000
but only one day apart, and I feel like something’s missing.

125
00:14:20,730 --> 00:14:24,060
I’m not sure what you’re asking.

126
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:46,030
Mr. Pie,

127
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:53,330
I’m feeling unwell, so I’ll have to postpone uploading the novel today.

128
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:58,760
Where are you? Why is it so noisy?

129
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:03,360
I’m getting an IV drip at the hospital.

130
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:07,760
But I’m fine, I’ll be able to go home soon.

131
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:14,060
Okay, let me know when you get home.

132
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:16,060
Sure.

133
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:27,730
Hi.
Hi.

134
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:29,430
Did I make you wait?

135
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:30,860
No.

136
00:15:31,130 --> 00:15:35,760
I bought some tasty popcorn from SF for you, Min.

137
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:41,100
You’re so sweet. Do you like me or something?

138
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:46,760
Don’t say you don’t!

139
00:15:47,460 --> 00:15:49,530
I like ...

140
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:52,700
watching movies with someone sweet.

141
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:54,660
I’mma pinch you.

142
00:15:56,030 --> 00:16:00,960
Hey, P’Ozone, Final Destination is fully booked.

143
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:03,160
Should we come back another day?

144
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:05,260
But you really want to watch it.

145
00:16:08,260 --> 00:16:11,430
I couldn’t book two seats next to each other.

146
00:16:12,530 --> 00:16:15,760
There are two seats, but someone’s sitting between us.

147
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:22,330
It’s okay. I’ll just ask them to swap seats with me.

148
00:16:23,830 --> 00:16:27,160
Let’s go inside.
Go go.

149
00:16:28,660 --> 00:16:29,760
Come on.

150
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:37,530
Excuse me.

151
00:16:37,530 --> 00:16:41,060
Excuse me. We have two people. Can we switch seats with you?

152
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:46,860
No.

153
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:55,860
Never mind, boss Are you here to watch the movie too?

154
00:17:00,330 --> 00:17:04,060
You know him? Why is he so cold?

155
00:17:04,530 --> 00:17:10,300
He’s someone I can’t mess with. Let’s just stick to our original seats.

156
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:12,800
Okay.
Alright.

157
00:17:40,630 --> 00:17:42,500
P’Ozone, want some popcorn?

158
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:45,030
Sure, thanks.

159
00:17:55,830 --> 00:17:58,200
Min, do you want a drink?

160
00:17:58,200 --> 00:17:59,900
Oh, thank you.

161
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:08,930
Would you like a drink too, boss?

162
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:33,430
P’Ozone, I’m scared.

163
00:18:33,430 --> 00:18:35,800
Don’t worry, I’ll protect you.

164
00:18:52,730 --> 00:18:54,930
Ten minutes ago …

165
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:58,730
Weren’t you supposed to be in the hospital?

166
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:06,830
I’m a teenager, so I recover fast.

167
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:09,060
You look fine to me.

168
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:17,830
If I reward you by having you upload ten chapters,

169
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:21,460
you’ll have no problem, right?

170
00:19:25,930 --> 00:19:31,100
No problem, just a piece of cake.

171
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:54,730
I’m back.

172
00:19:57,130 --> 00:20:00,800
You’re back half an hour earlier.

173
00:20:01,130 --> 00:20:02,900
There was no traffic.

174
00:20:03,630 --> 00:20:05,700
Have you eaten?

175
00:20:07,130 --> 00:20:09,360
Not yet, and you?

176
00:20:10,030 --> 00:20:15,730
Same here, but that’s good. I’ll cook for you.

177
00:20:15,930 --> 00:20:19,530
This is shrimp, your favorite.

178
00:20:19,830 --> 00:20:20,930
Shrimp!

179
00:20:21,730 --> 00:20:22,500
Let’s eat.

180
00:21:02,330 --> 00:21:03,900
It smells great.

181
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:07,860
If this black pepper shrimp is good, can you post it on Instagram and tag me?

182
00:21:08,030 --> 00:21:11,300
Are you sure? You might lose some fans.

183
00:21:23,860 --> 00:21:25,330
Careful, it’s hot.

184
00:21:30,460 --> 00:21:33,660
Shoot, so salty!

185
00:21:39,730 --> 00:21:41,030
Delicious.

186
00:21:42,860 --> 00:21:44,460
Let me take a picture.

187
00:21:44,630 --> 00:21:48,830
I thought it would be too salty since I added a lot of salt.

188
00:21:48,830 --> 00:21:51,330
No, it’s not salty. I like strong flavors.

189
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:59,930
This is the best black pepper shrimp in the world.

190
00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:06,530
Can you see if this caption and filter are okay?

191
00:22:07,060 --> 00:22:09,730
Yeah, looks good.

192
00:22:10,830 --> 00:22:12,000
Okay.

193
00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:18,230
Someone’s already commented.

194
00:22:20,060 --> 00:22:25,430
Little Prince posted a food pic again. I love shrimp too, so I’ll give this a like.

195
00:22:26,030 --> 00:22:29,730
Impressive! Good at both writing and cooking.

196
00:22:29,930 --> 00:22:35,430
Why does it look less appetizing than before? Is Little Prince losing his touch?

197
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:41,000
Seems like I need more practice.

198
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:46,030
The appearance doesn’t matter, it’s the taste that counts.

199
00:22:56,800 --> 00:23:00,760
Are you taking a photo of me? Do I look bad?

200
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:02,360
Not at all.

201
00:23:04,430 --> 00:23:06,000
You look adorable.

202
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:14,560
(Shi Er Ye added a photo: The gluttonous Little Prince.)

203
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:16,730
Why are these two together again? @Shan @Ob-aun

204
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:20,760
It’s like they’re always together.

205
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:22,760
Wanna explain?

206
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:31,960
I’ll explain to them.

207
00:23:33,630 --> 00:23:36,960
I happened to be working in the area, so Little Prince treated me to a meal.

208
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:39,200
Oh? I wish someone would treat me to a meal.

209
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:41,900
You can come, but you have to be here in ten minutes since we’re leaving.

210
00:23:41,900 --> 00:23:44,730
How am I supposed to make it?

211
00:23:55,460 --> 00:23:59,460
Thanks, but you don’t need to peel it for me.

212
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:02,600
You should eat it.

213
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:07,900
It’s okay, I can’t eat because I’m allergic to shrimp.

214
00:24:08,260 --> 00:24:12,260
What? Why did you choose shrimp then?

215
00:24:13,460 --> 00:24:15,700
Because my special one loves it.

216
00:24:23,530 --> 00:24:28,830
Oh, your girlfriend, right?

217
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:32,230
I don’t have a girlfriend.

218
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:37,460
I don’t have one either, but I know the rules.

219
00:24:37,460 --> 00:24:40,500
I can help you if you’re trying to woo someone.

220
00:24:42,030 --> 00:24:45,300
Then, what should I do …

221
00:24:45,300 --> 00:24:47,730
if I want to kiss them?

222
00:24:47,860 --> 00:24:49,330
Are you alright?

223
00:24:56,300 --> 00:24:57,830
Yeah, I'm okay.

224
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:02,630
It’s all about timing. Just wait for the right moment.

225
00:25:03,130 --> 00:25:06,700
But are you really going to skip flirting and go straight to kissing?

226
00:25:11,230 --> 00:25:13,800
That’s what I’m debating.

227
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:17,830
I guess I’ll wait a bit longer.

228
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:35,160
You look upset.

229
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:45,300
I wasn’t trying to …

230
00:25:48,900 --> 00:25:52,000
You weren’t trying to ... what?

231
00:25:58,560 --> 00:26:01,630
I’m done eating, I’ll go first.

232
00:26:14,260 --> 00:26:18,200
His cooking’s this bad, no wonder he can’t get a date.

233
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:26,630
Hey. What are you watching? Is it fun?

234
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:30,330
Yes.

235
00:26:31,700 --> 00:26:32,900
Really?

236
00:26:33,230 --> 00:26:34,360
Yes.

237
00:26:36,100 --> 00:26:39,160
You’re still young, do you really need it?

238
00:26:39,930 --> 00:26:41,300
Yes.

239
00:26:41,300 --> 00:26:46,960
Ever since I started using this enhancement pill, my wife has been really pleased

240
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:57,000
Hey, don’t laugh.

241
00:26:58,530 --> 00:27:03,130
Stop laughing! I said stop. What are you laughing at?

242
00:27:03,130 --> 00:27:04,330
Ouch!

243
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:17,330
Sorry.

244
00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:28,560
Hey, do you think you’re in a teen romance series?

245
00:27:34,660 --> 00:27:38,260
Aren’t you going to get up?

246
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:07,600
Suddenly, He Zhi couldn't take it anymore.

247
00:28:14,530 --> 00:28:17,200
He slowly moved closer to Xu Yiming.

248
00:28:25,130 --> 00:28:26,600
And then...

249
00:28:59,730 --> 00:29:07,060
I’m so lucky to have found you.

250
00:29:07,060 --> 00:29:13,160
To meet you and stand by your side.

251
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:19,600
Whatever comes, it's you I'll hold,

252
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:31,400
I see you’re the reason my smile unfolds.

253
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:37,630
I’m so lucky to have found you.

254
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:34,530
I ... I’m feeling sleepy. I’m going to bed.

255
00:31:12,460 --> 00:31:15,400
What does it mean by kissing without saying anything?

256
00:31:16,300 --> 00:31:18,300
I’m ready.

257
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:26,000
Do you know why Shan kissed me?

258
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:29,260
I’m going to help you find the reason for kissing.

259
00:31:29,260 --> 00:31:31,500
Hey, I didn’t ask for that!

260
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:37,430
First, instinct. Animals also have behaviors similar to kissing.

261
00:31:37,430 --> 00:31:40,560
Gorillas often display kissing behaviors.

262
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:46,260
And chimpanzees in Africa even use their tongues while kissing.

263
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:49,600
Kissing is that common?

264
00:31:49,900 --> 00:31:55,960
Studies show that human kissing evolved from primates.

265
00:31:57,160 --> 00:31:58,330
Whatever.

266
00:31:59,460 --> 00:32:05,560
Second, to gather genetic information and find a compatible mate.

267
00:32:05,900 --> 00:32:08,730
The mouth is the most sensitive part of human body,

268
00:32:08,730 --> 00:32:13,760
having nerves connected to the brain's pleasure center.

269
00:32:14,230 --> 00:32:18,060
Third, kissing can help you lose weight.

270
00:32:18,060 --> 00:32:24,530
When you passionately kiss someone, all 34 muscles in your face are activated.

271
00:32:24,530 --> 00:32:30,130
A minute of intense kissing can burn up to 12 calories.

272
00:32:33,900 --> 00:32:36,630
Shan didn’t kiss me to lose weight for sure.

273
00:32:37,030 --> 00:32:42,130
It would make more sense if he was studying kissing for a novel.

274
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:46,600
So, why did he kiss me?

275
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:53,560
So hot. I’m burning up.

276
00:32:53,560 --> 00:32:55,860
It’s the drug’s effect. Hang in there.

277
00:32:56,100 --> 00:32:57,870
I'm at my limit.

278
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:05,900
Even if you’re the revered master of the Bu Zhou mountain sect …

279
00:33:06,130 --> 00:33:07,930
Do you really need to go this far?

280
00:33:10,100 --> 00:33:16,130
you can't resist the scorching desire in my illusion.

281
00:33:18,500 --> 00:33:19,730
Let go.

282
00:33:23,660 --> 00:33:27,160
Fine, I'll do it. Don’t regret this later.

283
00:33:30,300 --> 00:33:36,800
How embarrassing. Who knew the great master Shen would be into this kind of thing?

284
00:34:02,830 --> 00:34:04,300
This is not good.

285
00:34:04,630 --> 00:34:09,800
The master’s blood can neutralize my poison.

286
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:14,060
Has Shen An been pretending all along?

287
00:34:29,900 --> 00:34:31,659
What just happened?

288
00:34:36,429 --> 00:34:38,699
We were in an illusion.

289
00:34:38,699 --> 00:34:42,360
The demon used the desires in people’s hearts as bait.

290
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:48,330
So we had to combine our martial skills to get out of it.

291
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:16,530
Mr. President.

292
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:18,530
Yes?

293
00:35:25,230 --> 00:35:26,830
Let’s start the meeting.

294
00:35:28,230 --> 00:35:32,860
Today’s agenda will be an analysis of Rose Art Company’s investments.

295
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:36,830
I’ll briefly introduce the company to everyone.

296
00:35:37,330 --> 00:35:41,360
This company is a fully integrated media and film company,

297
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:43,860
mainly dealing in licensing …

298
00:35:47,330 --> 00:35:53,400
Ob-aun might be shocked. I wanted to express my feelings,

299
00:35:54,260 --> 00:35:56,260
but I ended up kissing him.

300
00:35:57,100 --> 00:35:58,860
Mr. President.

301
00:36:00,060 --> 00:36:04,930
That’s all for the detailed reports on the company. Do you have any questions?

302
00:36:16,060 --> 00:36:21,930
Everyone, I apologize, I’ve been feeling fatigued for a few days.

303
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:25,130
I suggest we take a break and continue later.

304
00:37:06,260 --> 00:37:07,560
Hello?

305
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:11,200
I came to work in Chiang Mai and didn’t get a chance to tell you.

306
00:37:12,060 --> 00:37:13,800
Oh, okay.

307
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:16,860
What are you doing?

308
00:37:17,260 --> 00:37:22,430
Watering the plants. What about you?

309
00:37:22,830 --> 00:37:25,160
I just took a break from a meeting.

310
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:31,000
You must be really tired. When will it be done?

311
00:37:31,460 --> 00:37:35,160
This is the last meeting. I’ll be free after that.

312
00:37:36,530 --> 00:37:39,000
Hang in there.

313
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:45,700
Are you watering the plants because of writer’s block again?

314
00:37:46,430 --> 00:37:48,430
Whose fault is it?

315
00:37:48,660 --> 00:37:49,930
Hello?

316
00:37:49,930 --> 00:37:51,100
Hm.

317
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:55,860
Yeah, I’m stuck.

318
00:37:57,860 --> 00:37:59,660
Why don’t you go to my room?

319
00:37:59,660 --> 00:38:00,960
Huh?

320
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:06,560
I usually jot down inspirations and post them on a board.

321
00:38:07,030 --> 00:38:10,530
Go check it out. Maybe it’ll spark some ideas.

322
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:15,960
I don’t know, it’s your inspiration.

323
00:38:16,730 --> 00:38:18,300
What’s wrong with that?

324
00:38:18,300 --> 00:38:23,000
If you can bring those ideas to life, I should be thanking you.

325
00:38:23,430 --> 00:38:26,160
Otherwise, they’re just words.

326
00:38:27,460 --> 00:38:30,500
I’ll go back to the meeting now.

327
00:38:44,860 --> 00:38:46,360
There really is something.

328
00:38:57,830 --> 00:39:02,360
The weapon’s hidden in the pen’s tip, inseparable from it.

329
00:39:53,500 --> 00:39:57,130
Hello, Mr. Ob-aun. Here’s the chocolate ice cream cake you ordered.

330
00:40:05,930 --> 00:40:08,600
Eating dessert at the perfect timing.

331
00:40:25,300 --> 00:40:27,260
Hey, what’s going on?

332
00:40:27,260 --> 00:40:31,200
Can’t you see? Our company’s bankrupt with a billion in debt.

333
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:34,660
If you have anything important, you’d better go get it. Good luck.

334
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:53,500
Saving the plants and fish.

335
00:40:55,900 --> 00:41:01,260
Detective novel writers are really good at making clues.

336
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:03,800
In the midst of the night,

337
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:06,030
Shen An, where are you?

338
00:41:06,030 --> 00:41:07,160
I’m here.

339
00:41:07,160 --> 00:41:08,030
They kissed.

340
00:41:08,030 --> 00:41:09,730
We ...

341
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:47,160
This is an idea about The Villain’s strategy guide.

342
00:41:47,500 --> 00:41:51,530
Whoa, Shan, what a sweet scene.

343
00:41:52,430 --> 00:41:58,560
I’ve crossed many bridges, seen countless clouds, and drank various liquors,

344
00:41:58,560 --> 00:42:02,200
but I only fell in love with one person at the right time.

345
00:42:02,700 --> 00:42:04,860
This was Shan’s old idea.

346
00:42:05,700 --> 00:42:08,700
So this is the latter part of it.

347
00:42:42,260 --> 00:42:43,630
This ...

348
00:42:47,500 --> 00:42:49,500
When we're on the bus back then...

349
00:43:37,260 --> 00:43:38,900
P’Ozone, are you at the event yet?

350
00:43:39,400 --> 00:43:41,460
Yes. Where are you?

351
00:43:41,800 --> 00:43:45,200
I’m not there yet. The traffic is bad, so I might be late.

352
00:43:45,460 --> 00:43:47,200
How’s it going over there?

353
00:43:47,460 --> 00:43:51,230
Don’t worry. I’ll teach your stupid ex a lesson.

354
00:43:54,630 --> 00:43:56,930
I’ve been planning this for a while.

355
00:43:56,930 --> 00:44:01,630
Trust me, it’s something he will never forget.

356
00:44:09,230 --> 00:44:10,730
Hi, Ozone.

357
00:44:10,730 --> 00:44:13,030
Congratulations! I’ve got a gift for you.

358
00:44:13,030 --> 00:44:14,660
Hey you.

359
00:44:17,900 --> 00:44:19,660
Hey you.

360
00:44:23,030 --> 00:44:25,600
I’m the bride’s friend.

361
00:44:26,130 --> 00:44:29,060
What a coincidence, you’re the groom’s friend too?

362
00:44:30,430 --> 00:44:33,230
Uncle Pie is the groom’s uncle.

363
00:44:38,560 --> 00:44:41,600
Ah, Uncle.

364
00:44:42,630 --> 00:44:44,730
He looks familiar.

365
00:44:45,100 --> 00:44:47,900
Oh, did you say you have something for me?

366
00:44:55,560 --> 00:44:57,330
Yeah.

367
00:45:13,260 --> 00:45:16,260
Director
Nathawat Piyanonpong

368
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:20,960
Everything was fine yesterday, but now you're pushing me away.

369
00:45:20,960 --> 00:45:24,760
I really like you, and I’ve always been. I mean it.

370
00:45:24,760 --> 00:45:28,860
If they really end up together, they’d make a good couple.

371
00:45:28,860 --> 00:45:30,130
What are you doing?

372
00:45:30,700 --> 00:45:33,460
What’s the relationship between you and Ob-aun?

373
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:36,030
Who’s there?

374
00:45:36,030 --> 00:45:39,460
My name’s Ob-aun. Shan Yao is my cat.

375
00:45:39,460 --> 00:45:42,200
Can I come play with him tomorrow?

376
00:45:42,530 --> 00:45:44,200
You'll be able to see tomorrow?

377
00:45:44,200 --> 00:45:46,360
Yeah, the doctor’s going to treat my eyes tomorrow.

378
00:45:46,360 --> 00:45:48,560
I’ll bring back some chocolate cake for you.

379
00:45:48,560 --> 00:45:51,000
Really? I’ll be waiting!

380
00:45:54,030 --> 00:45:56,760
Ob-aun.
