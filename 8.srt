1
00:00:00,580 --> 00:00:09,600
All occurrences in this series are fictionally created for entertainment purposes only. Viewer discretion is advised.

2
00:00:15,270 --> 00:00:16,870
Lucky I got out in time.

3
00:00:17,020 --> 00:00:19,190
I almost got exposed.

4
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:24,270
My side account nearly got caught.

5
00:00:25,420 --> 00:00:26,470
Lian’er.

6
00:00:27,340 --> 00:00:31,790
Yeah, who would’ve thought the comments section would blow up because of Lian’er?

7
00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:36,520
Ozone, how many plotlines did you plan out? Tell me.

8
00:00:38,590 --> 00:00:41,570
Ozone, what’s the deal with Lian’er?

9
00:00:42,220 --> 00:00:44,540
I cut a lot of her scenes already.

10
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:47,050
Why’d you write more?

11
00:00:48,290 --> 00:00:49,490
Well, I ...

12
00:00:54,570 --> 00:00:58,350
I’m suffering, but I can’t say anything.

13
00:00:58,750 --> 00:01:02,650
Lian’er is me. I am Lian’er.

14
00:01:03,020 --> 00:01:07,000
I found out a secret a few days ago, but I can’t tell anyone.

15
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:12,470
It’s killing me, so I vented by writing it into the story.

16
00:01:13,070 --> 00:01:16,270
That’s why I created a character full of worries.

17
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:21,920
If Lian’er is Shen An and Duan Ru Xing’s evil mother-in-law,

18
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:28,000
then I’m probably the godmother of God Shan and Little Ob-aun.

19
00:01:34,870 --> 00:01:38,700
I really went off-topic with this one. P’Jao Samut, can you wrap up for me again?

20
00:01:38,870 --> 00:01:40,620
She’s not relevant to the plot anymore.

21
00:01:41,050 --> 00:01:41,950
Okay.

22
00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:46,750
By the way, when is Shan going to write the intimate scene?

23
00:01:52,150 --> 00:01:55,450
Believe in Master Si Er Ye. It might be soon.

24
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:56,720
Right?

25
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:00,850
Yeah, very soon.

26
00:02:07,250 --> 00:02:10,400
I can’t take it anymore. I’m about to lose my mind!

27
00:02:10,550 --> 00:02:15,470
I need to vent somewhere else, not the novel again.

28
00:02:15,570 --> 00:02:18,770
I can’t post something on Instagram either.

29
00:02:18,850 --> 00:02:22,450
I don’t feel comfortable sharing it with anyone outside the group.

30
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:26,670
And talking to close friends feels like gossiping behind his back.

31
00:02:27,020 --> 00:02:30,400
Wait, there is someone who’s perfect for this.

32
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:33,950
He can keep secrets and is someone close.

33
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:43,470
Pharinyakorn Khansawa

Director
Nathawat Piyanonpong

43
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:47,900
Hey, I need to talk to you.

44
00:03:48,670 --> 00:03:49,670
I’m busy.

45
00:03:49,870 --> 00:03:53,320
Come on, boss, I’m begging you. Please hear me out.

46
00:03:56,650 --> 00:03:57,900
You need my help again?

47
00:03:58,350 --> 00:04:02,100
Again? What do you mean again? I don’t ask for help that often.

48
00:04:02,420 --> 00:04:03,470
For sure.

49
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:09,050
So, are you done writing the draft?

50
00:04:09,650 --> 00:04:12,570
Forget the novel!

51
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:16,800
I found out something, and I’ll explode if I keep it to myself.

52
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:18,420
I just need to talk to someone.

53
00:04:25,770 --> 00:04:28,850
I couldn’t have imagined it!

54
00:04:31,650 --> 00:04:33,770
What are they going to do next?

55
00:04:33,770 --> 00:04:35,250
They’re both guys.

56
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:40,070
If they want to get married, they’ll have to do it abroad, and I’ll have to fly there.

57
00:04:40,070 --> 00:04:43,170
And if I fly there, will they pay for my ticket?

58
00:04:44,370 --> 00:04:48,100
And if I go, what wedding gift should I bring?

59
00:04:48,770 --> 00:04:50,420
I really have no idea.

60
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:57,470
You’re smiling at me.

61
00:04:57,820 --> 00:04:59,400
You’re not mad at me anymore?

62
00:05:00,950 --> 00:05:02,650
Who said I was mad at you, hm?

63
00:05:05,470 --> 00:05:07,120
Are you done talking?

64
00:05:08,870 --> 00:05:10,570
You’re no fun.

65
00:05:12,420 --> 00:05:14,920
But you might not need to go abroad,

66
00:05:15,470 --> 00:05:18,870
because the same-sex marriage law has passed now.

67
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:21,220
That’s right.

68
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:25,070
Anyway, just wait for me a bit.

69
00:05:25,070 --> 00:05:27,000
I’ll finish up my work,

70
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:29,000
and then we can go eat together.

71
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:30,750
Okay.

72
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:01,190
Hey.

73
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:04,120
Hey, what are you doing?

74
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:06,640
Looking at my boyfriend.

75
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:11,740
Hey.

76
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:23,720
Hey.

77
00:06:25,890 --> 00:06:27,320
Go take a shower first.

78
00:06:28,370 --> 00:06:30,470
Please? Pretty please?

79
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:34,470
Go take a shower.

80
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:23,220
Good thing I don't have any eye boogers.

81
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:31,850
Hm? Hello?

82
00:07:32,450 --> 00:07:34,850
Hey, I have a question.

83
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:36,150
What is it?

84
00:07:37,070 --> 00:07:39,650
Well …

85
00:07:40,550 --> 00:07:43,700
What do couples do when they’re dating?

86
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:47,770
I’m just trying to find new ideas.

87
00:07:48,420 --> 00:07:52,620
That’s the only reason? Is there anything else?

88
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:55,370
No, nothing else.

89
00:07:56,070 --> 00:07:57,050
Fine.

90
00:07:58,050 --> 00:08:02,770
Just read some novels and see what couples do.

91
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:06,870
Are you crazy? I can’t copy others’ novels.

92
00:08:07,370 --> 00:08:08,800
That’s true.

93
00:08:09,220 --> 00:08:12,570
How about real life stories people share online? That might work.

94
00:08:15,220 --> 00:08:16,670
I’ll send it to you.

95
00:08:17,950 --> 00:08:19,650
Alright, that’s it.

96
00:08:20,370 --> 00:08:21,520
Thank you.

97
00:08:28,350 --> 00:08:29,950
"Little things your partner does that makes your heart race."

98
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,350
So, what do people do when they’re dating?

99
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:35,150
I thought confessing was the hardest part.

100
00:08:35,799 --> 00:08:38,720
But it turns out dating is even harder.

101
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:42,299
Since I said yes,

102
00:08:43,570 --> 00:08:48,900
my face turns completely red whenever I see Shan.

103
00:08:49,250 --> 00:08:52,650
And I start stuttering. This is not normal.

104
00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:04,550
I remember last winter when we went on a trip together. It was freezing.

105
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:12,020
The heater in our room wasn’t working, so my husband put my feet on him to keep me warm.

106
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:15,800
That was not long after we started dating.

107
00:09:35,770 --> 00:09:38,000
Let me see … what else do they have?

108
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:41,520
The thing that makes my heart race the most is …

109
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:46,100
No matter how busy I get, my husband always makes sure to stock up the fridge.

110
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:52,100
There was one time when I came home late after work, and he woke up to cook instant noodles for me.

111
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:57,750
He said he’d never let me starve.

112
00:10:08,350 --> 00:10:11,000
The weather’s nice today, let’s go for a walk.

113
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:24,600
Shower and dress up nicely. I’ll see you later.

114
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:43,850
It’s been a while since we last walked together.

115
00:10:45,850 --> 00:10:48,000
It’s my fault, I’ve been working too much.

116
00:10:49,050 --> 00:10:53,500
So, let’s go for walks more often while I’m here.

117
00:10:54,570 --> 00:10:55,450
Sure.

118
00:10:57,250 --> 00:10:58,170
Oh.

119
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:00,720
I’ve got an event in two days.

120
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:01,970
What event?

121
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:05,100
A press conference for ‘Deception’.

122
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:07,120
Did you finalize everything?

123
00:11:08,370 --> 00:11:10,550
Who’s the director and the lead actor?

124
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:14,300
Andy Lee is the director, and Gu Jiaran is the male lead.

125
00:11:15,070 --> 00:11:19,750
Wow, Andy Lee! He’s a rising director with amazing work.

126
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:22,570
He won an award at an international film festival last year.

127
00:11:22,570 --> 00:11:26,920
And Gu Jiaran? He’s handsome and super talented.

128
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:29,000
Sin is also his fan.

129
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:31,500
I like both of them.

130
00:11:31,670 --> 00:11:33,250
And who wrote the script?

131
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:35,750
Is it you?

132
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:38,600
Nope.

133
00:11:39,220 --> 00:11:42,320
I’m not a screenwriter, but they put my name on it.

134
00:11:42,620 --> 00:11:45,250
So I just give some input on small details and overall.

135
00:11:48,670 --> 00:11:50,300
Let’s keep walking.

136
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:55,320
Okay.

137
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:10,350
The press conference is the day after tomorrow.

138
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:14,220
And now you’re telling me the screenwriter dropped out?

139
00:12:14,570 --> 00:12:15,970
I’m sorry, Mr. President.

140
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:20,500
The screenwriter said he suddenly fell ill, so he can’t work with us this time.

141
00:12:22,820 --> 00:12:23,900
Okay.

142
00:12:24,770 --> 00:12:26,420
Do we have a backup plan?

143
00:12:29,770 --> 00:12:30,870
Mr. President,

144
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:34,120
in Rose Art Company that we invested in earlier,

145
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:39,900
there’s a writer using the pen name Mohly, who has experience

146
00:12:40,470 --> 00:12:42,620
and was interested in working with us.

147
00:12:44,070 --> 00:12:45,570
Mohly, huh?

148
00:12:45,850 --> 00:12:48,070
Give me a brief on them.

149
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:49,050
Yes, sir.

150
00:12:52,250 --> 00:12:53,170
Here you go.

151
00:13:03,020 --> 00:13:07,450
Mr. President, do we need President Shan’s approval for the new screenwriter?

152
00:13:07,450 --> 00:13:11,800
No need. President Shan is busy as ever.

153
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:14,550
He doesn’t have time to worry about these things.

154
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:19,200
He just needs to make a quick appearance at the press conference.

155
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:20,950
Understood.

156
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:38,720
Well.

157
00:13:39,570 --> 00:13:42,700
Let’s be real. This story revolves around me.

158
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:47,350
Half of the fairytale is about me.

159
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:53,350
So Gu Jiaran will probably talk about the story we created ten years ago.

160
00:13:55,750 --> 00:14:01,600
Since you finally decided to reveal your identity to the public,

161
00:14:02,650 --> 00:14:05,720
am I going to see you on TV?

162
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:11,550
Here’s the deal, I’ll roll out the red carpet for you.

163
00:14:11,550 --> 00:14:16,350
And have YS buy an ad, just for you.

164
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:19,970
It’ll say ... "Shan, the big boss."

165
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:22,200
Shan, the big boss, huh?

166
00:14:28,150 --> 00:14:30,320
What? Why are you pulling me?

167
00:14:30,850 --> 00:14:34,300
May I formally invite Mr. Ob-aun to attend the press conference …

168
00:14:35,620 --> 00:14:38,970
and listen to the fairytale from 10 years ago together?

169
00:14:41,070 --> 00:14:44,120
No official invitation letter or anything?

170
00:14:45,370 --> 00:14:46,300
There is.

171
00:15:00,170 --> 00:15:02,000
This is your invitation letter.

172
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:04,950
Please sign for it.

173
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:23,750
Signed.

174
00:15:30,370 --> 00:15:31,650
One more time.

175
00:15:46,270 --> 00:15:47,820
Sure, no problem.

176
00:15:48,070 --> 00:15:50,770
I’ll be at the press conference right on time.

177
00:15:51,070 --> 00:15:53,720
It’s an honor to work with Shan.

178
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:07,980
I’ve already transferred double the pay to your account. Hope it helps you recover faster.

179
00:16:11,450 --> 00:16:14,670
I’m looking forward to seeing you at the press conference, Shan.

180
00:16:15,020 --> 00:16:17,700
I’m preparing ... no,

181
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:20,450
Be prepared for a big surprise, everyone.

182
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:42,520
What are you watching? Why are you so happy?

183
00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:49,050
Who’s that? He’s handsome.

184
00:16:50,250 --> 00:16:51,320
If you like,

185
00:16:52,950 --> 00:16:54,500
I can ask for his autograph for you.

186
00:16:57,250 --> 00:16:58,570
But as long as I’m here,

187
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:02,050
I won’t allow you to admire other guys.

188
00:19:03,570 --> 00:19:05,520
The team booked quite a nice hotel.

189
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:09,450
Hello, sir, how may I help you?

190
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:11,770
I’m here for the ‘Deception’ press conference.

191
00:19:12,250 --> 00:19:14,420
May I have your name, sir?

192
00:19:14,420 --> 00:19:15,620
It’s Ob-aun.

193
00:19:15,950 --> 00:19:17,470
Mr. Ob-aun.

194
00:19:17,820 --> 00:19:20,420
Your room is on the 15th floor.

195
00:19:20,420 --> 00:19:22,950
Here’s your room key. Please hold on to it.

196
00:19:22,950 --> 00:19:24,020
Thank you.

197
00:19:24,020 --> 00:19:24,750
You’re welcome.

198
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:31,800
Hello.

199
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:32,850
I’m James.

200
00:19:35,420 --> 00:19:38,470
I’m sorry, but I don’t see your name on the list, sir.

201
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:41,970
Uh, well,

202
00:19:42,450 --> 00:19:47,400
I have an important matter to discuss with God Shan. Can you let me in to see him?

203
00:19:47,870 --> 00:19:49,470
I’m afraid that’s not possible.

204
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:53,450
How is that not possible? Could you check again? My name should be on the list.

205
00:19:53,450 --> 00:19:57,570
I bought the ticket. Do you know how much I paid?

206
00:19:57,800 --> 00:20:01,250
How can I not get in? I’ve got something important to tell him!

207
00:20:02,570 --> 00:20:04,050
Check it again!

208
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:07,020
What? I’m gonna see God Shan!

209
00:20:29,070 --> 00:20:30,220
You're here?

210
00:20:30,650 --> 00:20:33,450
I just came to prepare the room for you. Make yourself at home.

211
00:20:33,450 --> 00:20:35,770
I thought you were going to wait for me downstairs.

212
00:20:39,170 --> 00:20:40,650
If we were downstairs,

213
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:43,920
I wouldn’t be able to hug you like this, would I?

214
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:46,750
By the way,

215
00:20:47,220 --> 00:20:49,700
where are you sleeping tonight?

216
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:54,570
Here, of course.

217
00:20:55,970 --> 00:20:57,420
That might not be a good idea.

218
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:00,600
I have to work on my manuscript tonight.

219
00:21:02,970 --> 00:21:04,450
Little prince.

220
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:06,470
What are you thinking?

221
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:10,400
Nothing, really.

222
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,750
One knock is a warning.

223
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:16,550
Two knocks is testing the waters.

224
00:21:21,550 --> 00:21:23,420
Three knocks means I miss you.

225
00:21:31,650 --> 00:21:33,800
How long has it been since we did this?

226
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:40,250
I don’t know what’s wrong with me.

227
00:21:40,370 --> 00:21:47,650
The closer I get to you, the more I want to see you every day.

228
00:21:58,420 --> 00:22:01,650
When you go back, will you forget me?

229
00:22:07,050 --> 00:22:08,470
I’ll never forget you.

230
00:22:26,020 --> 00:22:27,450
(Deception)

231
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:35,720
Ladies and gentlemen,

232
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:37,770
and members of the press,

233
00:22:37,770 --> 00:22:42,200
welcome to the press conference for the movie adaptation of Deception.

234
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:45,700
I’m Min, your host for tonight.

235
00:22:51,350 --> 00:22:53,900
Nobody can match my Min.

236
00:22:54,770 --> 00:22:56,450
Pie is over there.

237
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:02,000
Let’s give a round of applause for Mr. Shan!

238
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:10,250
Hello.

239
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:20,450
I heard this is a collaboration between you and Mohly.

240
00:23:20,450 --> 00:23:23,470
Please welcome Mohly, the screenwriter!

241
00:23:31,100 --> 00:23:32,600
Intouch is the screenwriter?

242
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:34,600
Who’s that? Is he famous?

243
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:35,900
‘Mohly’ is Intouch.

244
00:23:35,900 --> 00:23:36,700
Intouch?

245
00:23:36,700 --> 00:23:39,200
Yeah, Intouch, the one who confessed to Shan.

246
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:40,220
What?!

247
00:23:42,420 --> 00:23:44,300
Hello.

248
00:23:45,020 --> 00:23:48,500
How do both of you feel about working together?

249
00:23:48,700 --> 00:23:50,400
I’m really excited.

250
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:54,600
Shan and I will do our best to make it a great piece.

251
00:23:58,370 --> 00:24:00,970
And what about you, Shan?

252
00:24:01,970 --> 00:24:05,700
Please support us and stay tuned for the release.

253
00:24:11,550 --> 00:24:14,420
Next, we’d like to invite the director,

254
00:24:14,420 --> 00:24:17,020
Andy Lee, to the stage!

255
00:24:23,550 --> 00:24:25,750
Hello.

256
00:24:25,870 --> 00:24:28,120
As a fan of Deception,

257
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:33,270
I’m sure Shan’s fans, including me, can't wait to see it.

258
00:24:33,370 --> 00:24:36,170
Do you have any message for us?

259
00:24:36,170 --> 00:24:40,670
Well, for various reasons,

260
00:24:40,670 --> 00:24:45,020
it’s rare to see original writers involved in adaptations.

261
00:24:45,020 --> 00:24:47,470
So this project is very special,

262
00:24:47,470 --> 00:24:51,950
and I’m thrilled to have the original writer as a consultant on this movie.

263
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:59,600
And Shan, do you have anything to say to your fans?

264
00:24:59,770 --> 00:25:02,520
I’m honored to be part of such a talented team

265
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:04,920
and be part of this amazing project.

266
00:25:08,300 --> 00:25:11,650
But that’s not all, we have one more surprise!

267
00:25:11,650 --> 00:25:16,470
Let’s welcome the lead actor of Deception, Gu Jiaran!

268
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:41,170
Hello.

269
00:25:42,870 --> 00:25:45,000
Hello, Gu Jiaran.

270
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,020
This way please.

271
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:52,020
How does it feel to take on the lead role in Deception?

272
00:25:52,050 --> 00:25:54,720
I’m so happy to receive this role.

273
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:57,850
The script of Deception fascinated me.

274
00:25:57,850 --> 00:26:02,350
So I hope everyone will support me. Thank you very much.

275
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:09,850
Alright, everyone, that concludes today’s press conference.

276
00:26:09,850 --> 00:26:15,020
I hope Deception gets released soon and is a huge success!

277
00:26:15,020 --> 00:26:17,400
Thank you so much!

278
00:26:18,550 --> 00:26:21,770
Let’s take a group photo.

279
00:26:24,770 --> 00:26:26,270
Look over here, please.

280
00:26:26,900 --> 00:26:28,450
This camera, too.

281
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:59,670
Excuse me for a moment.

282
00:27:08,580 --> 00:27:10,780
Please wait for me, I’ll go back with you.

283
00:27:12,030 --> 00:27:14,380
Okay, I’ll wait by the door.

284
00:27:25,620 --> 00:27:27,320
I’ll excuse myself.

285
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:38,770
When will you stop being mad at me?

286
00:27:41,370 --> 00:27:45,200
Don’t tell me you’re not mad. It’s obvious you are.

287
00:27:47,350 --> 00:27:48,650
I’m not mad at you.

288
00:27:48,820 --> 00:27:51,120
If you’re not, then stop acting like this around me.

289
00:27:53,870 --> 00:27:55,070
Acting like what?

290
00:27:58,470 --> 00:27:59,400
Like this?

291
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:14,300
Or like this?

292
00:28:21,850 --> 00:28:25,120
Why are you hugging me?

293
00:28:27,770 --> 00:28:29,150
And if you allow it,

294
00:28:30,470 --> 00:28:32,070
I’d like to kiss you, too.

295
00:28:33,550 --> 00:28:39,870
Do you know how hard it’s been to hold back?

296
00:28:39,870 --> 00:28:45,500
What am I supposed to do?

297
00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:53,370
I want to keep you safe and near, standing by your side forever here.

298
00:28:53,370 --> 00:28:55,070
Can I be the one for you?

299
00:28:55,070 --> 00:28:57,270
Hey, what’s the rush?

300
00:28:57,350 --> 00:28:59,500
Man, I get how you feel now.

301
00:28:59,500 --> 00:29:00,270
What?

302
00:29:00,270 --> 00:29:03,200
I’ll explain later, I gotta go!

303
00:29:12,050 --> 00:29:15,050
Hello, are you Ob-aun?

304
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:17,220
Yes.

305
00:29:18,750 --> 00:29:19,870
And you?

306
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:23,120
Hello, Ob-aun. I’m Mohly.

307
00:29:23,420 --> 00:29:25,170
You can call me Intouch.

308
00:29:26,250 --> 00:29:28,020
What is he up to?

309
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:30,870
Hello, Intouch.

310
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:35,420
Ob-aun, could we talk for a moment?

311
00:29:53,250 --> 00:29:54,450
Ob-aun.

312
00:29:55,700 --> 00:29:59,420
Do you know that Shan and I have been close since we were kids?

313
00:30:00,050 --> 00:30:04,220
Our families have always been close, and we grew up together.

314
00:30:05,970 --> 00:30:07,570
What are you trying to say?

315
00:30:08,220 --> 00:30:09,420
Nothing much.

316
00:30:09,700 --> 00:30:11,400
I just want you to know …

317
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:14,550
Shan and I are something more than you think.

318
00:30:18,450 --> 00:30:19,850
I guess you didn’t know.

319
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:24,470
There’s the time your parents asked Shan’s family for help when they were out of money.

320
00:30:25,420 --> 00:30:27,370
But Shan’s family ignored them.

321
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:31,850
So it led to a tragedy for your family.

322
00:31:06,150 --> 00:31:09,180
Hello, Ob-aun, are you in the room?

323
00:31:09,230 --> 00:31:10,630
I want to talk to you.

324
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:13,520
Yes, I’m here.

325
00:31:14,270 --> 00:31:17,070
Where are you?

326
00:31:18,330 --> 00:31:19,730
I’m outside the hotel.

327
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:24,300
I’ll come down. I have something to talk about, too.

328
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:40,600
Ob-aun!

329
00:31:50,150 --> 00:31:51,120
Shan!

330
00:31:51,300 --> 00:31:52,370
Ob-aun,

331
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:56,000
I’ve found you.

332
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:11,870
Help! Please help!

333
00:32:12,650 --> 00:32:19,000
Shan?

334
00:32:36,050 --> 00:32:37,320
Why can’t I see?

335
00:32:38,820 --> 00:32:39,820
Mom!

336
00:32:40,700 --> 00:32:41,750
Mom!

337
00:32:41,750 --> 00:32:42,670
Shan.

338
00:32:42,670 --> 00:32:43,670
Ob-aun?

339
00:32:43,950 --> 00:32:45,800
Shan, calm down.

340
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:47,170
Why can’t I see?

341
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:50,550
Just relax, Shan. Slowly, okay?

342
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:01,450
Take it easy, Shan.

343
00:33:04,900 --> 00:33:08,250
Slowly.

344
00:33:14,870 --> 00:33:16,350
Relax, Shan.

345
00:33:24,420 --> 00:33:26,870
The doctor has examined you thoroughly.

346
00:33:32,070 --> 00:33:35,850
He said it’s just a mild concussion.

347
00:33:36,950 --> 00:33:38,500
Nothing serious.

348
00:33:40,100 --> 00:33:41,120
But …

349
00:33:42,900 --> 00:33:47,800
The impact triggered your eye condition,

350
00:33:50,020 --> 00:33:51,550
that’s why you can’t see for now.

351
00:33:54,020 --> 00:33:55,550
Don’t worry,

352
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,100
the doctor said it can be treated.

353
00:34:00,270 --> 00:34:03,920
You just have to stay calm, alright?

354
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:14,150
Leave.

355
00:34:15,670 --> 00:34:19,920
I didn’t mean for Shan to get hurt by saving Ob-aun.

356
00:34:22,370 --> 00:34:27,350
You caused this and still dare to talk like that?

357
00:34:59,350 --> 00:35:00,620
Shan. Ob-aun.

358
00:35:01,220 --> 00:35:02,850
If you need anything, let me know.

359
00:35:03,770 --> 00:35:04,450
Alright.

360
00:35:05,020 --> 00:35:07,350
I’ll go pay the bill. You guys can head home.

361
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:10,670
Thank you, P'Akin.

362
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:36,900
Take it slow.

363
00:35:39,620 --> 00:35:41,170
Sit here for a moment.

364
00:35:47,770 --> 00:35:49,520
I’ll get your shoes.

365
00:36:08,250 --> 00:36:09,120
Ouch!

366
00:36:09,250 --> 00:36:11,300
I didn’t mean to!

367
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:12,670
Does it hurt?

368
00:36:17,050 --> 00:36:18,270
It hurts here,

369
00:36:19,450 --> 00:36:20,450
here,

370
00:36:22,170 --> 00:36:23,400
and here.

371
00:36:23,820 --> 00:36:24,750
Really?

372
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:26,650
Where?

373
00:36:37,950 --> 00:36:39,400
That many?

374
00:36:39,770 --> 00:36:43,420
Did I bump into you that hard?

375
00:36:45,250 --> 00:36:47,470
It maybe just one place,

376
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:51,700
but it spread all over.

377
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:56,250
Wait, isn’t it your neck that was hit?

378
00:36:57,500 --> 00:36:58,970
Well …

379
00:36:59,700 --> 00:37:01,570
My neck hurts too.

380
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,470
Ob-aun, I’m sorry.

381
00:37:17,270 --> 00:37:20,850
No, I’m sorry. You got hurt by saving me.

382
00:37:22,170 --> 00:37:26,170
I mean, about your parents.

383
00:37:27,700 --> 00:37:31,850
I heard from Intouch what happened back then.

384
00:37:35,270 --> 00:37:40,620
The most important thing right now is to get better quickly.

385
00:37:41,150 --> 00:37:42,920
Don’t worry about anything else, okay?

386
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:46,720
Alright.

387
00:37:48,950 --> 00:37:50,820
I’ll open the door.

388
00:38:36,070 --> 00:38:37,170
Hello.

389
00:38:44,750 --> 00:38:45,720
Shan.

390
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:48,300
Your mom’s here.

391
00:38:48,850 --> 00:38:49,870
Mom.

392
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,620
I missed you.
Yeah.

393
00:38:58,100 --> 00:39:00,050
Let me take you to sit down.

394
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:07,420
I’ll go get you some water, Mom.

395
00:39:07,650 --> 00:39:08,500
Thanks.

396
00:39:08,500 --> 00:39:09,770
I’ll help.

397
00:39:14,150 --> 00:39:15,170
Mom.

398
00:39:16,170 --> 00:39:18,770
I heard from Intouch about Ob-aun’s family.

399
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:22,350
What really happened?

400
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:30,000
Ten years ago, when you nearly regained your sight,

401
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:36,170
the doctors said to avoid any emotional stress. I didn’t want to risk your health,

402
00:39:38,350 --> 00:39:41,720
so I hid what was happening with Ob-aun’s family.

403
00:39:42,220 --> 00:39:45,370
I didn’t know you were carrying that burden for so long.

404
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:50,070
Mom.

405
00:39:51,720 --> 00:39:55,600
Did you help them back then?

406
00:39:58,120 --> 00:40:03,170
Do you really think your father and I were so heartless?

407
00:40:04,170 --> 00:40:05,270
No.

408
00:40:06,520 --> 00:40:10,070
I’m sure you had a reason not to tell me.

409
00:40:26,700 --> 00:40:32,020
Mom, I heard that Ob-aun’s family asked for your help.

410
00:40:32,020 --> 00:40:34,620
If you helped them,

411
00:40:34,620 --> 00:40:38,570
how did they still end up bankrupt, and his father … took his life?

412
00:40:38,570 --> 00:40:42,850
Intouch! You were young at the time. How could you know that it’s true?

413
00:40:45,770 --> 00:40:50,700
I didn’t realize this weighed on the three of you for so long.

414
00:40:52,050 --> 00:40:53,050
Never mind.

415
00:40:53,970 --> 00:40:58,670
You’re all adults now. It’s time you knew the truth.

416
00:41:02,520 --> 00:41:07,570
Ob-aun, your parents did come to us for help.

417
00:41:07,970 --> 00:41:12,550
That summer, their business ran into trouble,

418
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:15,400
and they needed a lot of money fast.

419
00:41:16,100 --> 00:41:17,400
After that,

420
00:41:18,870 --> 00:41:24,850
your father and I discussed it, and we agreed to lend them a sum of money.

421
00:41:25,070 --> 00:41:29,300
Then why did they still go bankrupt? Why did his father …

422
00:41:29,450 --> 00:41:30,870
It’s their business.

423
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:34,750
It wasn’t just a financial problem.

424
00:41:34,750 --> 00:41:37,150
There were legal issues too.

425
00:41:40,050 --> 00:41:41,120
Ob-aun.

426
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:47,620
Even if your father had gotten the money, he’d still have faced a trial …

427
00:41:48,620 --> 00:41:51,250
and possibly prison.

428
00:42:04,450 --> 00:42:05,820
Thank you.

429
00:42:08,370 --> 00:42:12,200
Actually, I’ve just remembered something.

430
00:42:16,220 --> 00:42:19,700
It’s too late now, don’t you see? Everything is too late.

431
00:42:20,020 --> 00:42:24,200
But Shan’s family promised to lend us money, didn’t they?

432
00:42:24,200 --> 00:42:26,300
I’ve already got the money to cover the debt,

433
00:42:27,050 --> 00:42:29,100
but I’ll still go to jail.

434
00:42:30,500 --> 00:42:32,620
Dad.
I won’t go to jail!

435
00:42:38,500 --> 00:42:40,320
Your father’s gone.

436
00:42:41,770 --> 00:42:46,250
Promise me you’ll grow up strong.

437
00:42:46,820 --> 00:42:49,500
Why is Dad lying there?

438
00:42:50,250 --> 00:42:51,670
Is he sleeping?

439
00:43:14,670 --> 00:43:18,050
I’m sorry. I’m so confused.

440
00:43:18,050 --> 00:43:20,050
Shan even got hurt saving me.

441
00:43:21,170 --> 00:43:23,200
I don’t know what to do.

442
00:43:27,070 --> 00:43:32,200
You’ve grown up, Ob-aun, but you’re still as sweet as when you were little.

443
00:43:34,870 --> 00:43:36,200
Thank you.

444
00:43:56,150 --> 00:43:58,870
Once you recover, hurry up and get engaged to Ob-aun.

445
00:43:59,720 --> 00:44:00,550
Yes.

446
00:44:01,020 --> 00:44:02,220
I’m leaving.

447
00:44:02,650 --> 00:44:03,550
Okay, mom.

448
00:44:21,900 --> 00:44:25,200
Director
Nathawat Piyanonpong

449
00:44:25,550 --> 00:44:26,450
Ouch!

450
00:44:26,450 --> 00:44:27,500
Be careful!

451
00:44:31,250 --> 00:44:34,820
If you want to grab water or do anything, just call me, okay?

452
00:44:35,220 --> 00:44:36,530
Anything?

453
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:38,080
Yes.

454
00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:39,960
Help me put on my pants.

455
00:44:43,590 --> 00:44:47,050
Whether you can see or not, I’ll always be with you.

456
00:44:47,050 --> 00:44:48,680
I’ll never leave you.
