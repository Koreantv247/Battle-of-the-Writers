2
00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:12,870
Walk slowly, you still can't see well.

3
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:25,550
Can you sit and wait for me on the bed?

4
00:00:27,970 --> 00:00:29,120
Take it slow.

5
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:32,520
Sit down.

6
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:40,170
Your vision is still blurry.

7
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:44,450
Let's sleep in the same room

8
00:00:45,220 --> 00:00:46,750
so I can take care of you.

9
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:01,220
Shan ...

10
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:04,550
Intouch told me that …

11
00:01:06,620 --> 00:01:08,250
you two grew up together.

12
00:01:09,770 --> 00:01:11,820
And your mom seems close to him, too.

13
00:01:17,050 --> 00:01:19,080
Our families had business together,

14
00:01:20,870 --> 00:01:22,600
so we met often when we were kids.

15
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:30,820
But I never played on the swings with him,

16
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,120
never read Jin Yong or watch cartoons,

17
00:01:38,050 --> 00:01:40,050
and I never gave him an award.

18
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:45,110
I’ve only ever done those things with you.

19
00:01:53,170 --> 00:01:56,020
Do you want some water? I'll go get it for you.

20
00:02:59,450 --> 00:03:02,450
Pharinyakorn Khansawa
as Ob-aun.

21
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:06,320
Koraphat Lamnoi

22
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:11,050

23
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:14,470

24
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:18,829
Willi Anavil
as Sin.

25
00:03:20,610 --> 00:03:22,870

26

Zale Ruan

28
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:35,190
Chaianun Chaichaowarat
as Intouch

29
00:03:42,470 --> 00:03:47,070
Director
Nathawat Piyanonpong

30
00:04:17,950 --> 00:04:18,850
Ouch!

31
00:04:18,850 --> 00:04:19,899
Be careful!

32
00:04:28,570 --> 00:04:30,710
Why did you walk over?

33
00:04:30,950 --> 00:04:33,820
I just wanted to get some water, sorry for troubling you.

34
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:36,150
No trouble at all.

35
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,900
Next time, If you want to grab water or do anything, just call me, okay?

36
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:45,400
Anything?

37
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:48,450
Yes.

38
00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:10,350
Then I’ll be in your care.

39
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:24,500
Stop acting cute. I'll go get the food.

40
00:05:28,290 --> 00:05:29,630
Let me put it down.

41
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:41,570
This smells like coconut milk and curry paste, no fishy scent of seafood.

42
00:05:41,770 --> 00:05:45,650
We don’t have beef, so it might be green chicken curry.

43
00:05:52,650 --> 00:05:55,270
Mango scent. It must be mango sticky rice.

44
00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:04,120
Slight sour smell from lime

45
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:08,140
and there’s a hint of garlic, it’s probably Som Tam (Papaya salad).

46
00:06:15,350 --> 00:06:17,950
All correct. You’re too good at this.

47
00:06:17,950 --> 00:06:22,150
As expected from the great god of mystery novels.

48
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:24,950
I get everything right.

49
00:06:26,070 --> 00:06:27,920
Shouldn't I get a reward?

50
00:06:36,670 --> 00:06:39,120
I didn’t ask you to kiss me on the cheek.

51
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:41,820
I want you to feed me.

52
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:45,970
Huh? Then why were you offering your cheek? Move back.

53
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:52,620
What do you want to eat?

54
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:55,350
Anything. I like everything you feed me.

55
00:06:57,050 --> 00:06:58,200
Alright.

56
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:06,000
What’s with the smile?

57
00:07:07,150 --> 00:07:08,300
Nothing.

58
00:07:16,670 --> 00:07:18,370
Say ah ...

59
00:07:33,850 --> 00:07:35,670
Delicious.
Ow!

60
00:07:35,970 --> 00:07:39,250
Hey! Sorry, I spilled it all over.

61
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:42,970
It's okay. I’ll go get changed.

62
00:07:42,970 --> 00:07:46,200
The Cola soaked through your shirt. You better take a shower,

63
00:07:47,050 --> 00:07:48,600
or it’ll get all sticky.

64
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:51,500
Okay.

65
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:55,920
Slowly.

66
00:07:56,170 --> 00:07:57,570
Go take a shower.

67
00:07:59,170 --> 00:08:00,400
Careful now.

68
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:23,540
Help me take off my shirt, please.

69
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:47,520
Take me to the shower.

70
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:53,600
Okay.

71
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:56,570
This way.

72
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:04,620
Here’s the soap, and here’s the showerhead.

73
00:09:07,020 --> 00:09:08,650
The towel is over here.

74
00:09:08,650 --> 00:09:11,600
Call me when you’re done, I’ll be waiting outside.

75
00:10:45,970 --> 00:10:47,570
Wait, don't walk yet.

76
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:52,420
I said, don't walk.

77
00:10:57,570 --> 00:10:58,720
Sit down.

78
00:11:04,550 --> 00:11:07,400
Your clothes are here. Call me when you’re done changing.

79
00:11:11,250 --> 00:11:12,170
Hey.

80
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:15,200
This is hard. I can’t see.

81
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:18,700
Help me put on my pants.

82
00:11:38,970 --> 00:11:40,070
Come on.

83
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:43,000
Hold my shoulder.

84
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:45,530
Lift your right leg.

85
00:12:08,570 --> 00:12:09,670
Hey.

86
00:12:13,970 --> 00:12:15,170
Okay.

87
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:19,040
All done.

88
00:12:20,350 --> 00:12:21,570
Shan.

89
00:12:24,670 --> 00:12:26,220
Sit down first.

90
00:12:59,060 --> 00:13:01,860
It’s done. You can rest now.

91
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:05,510
Okay, get up slowly.

92
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:11,800
Stand here for a moment.

93
00:13:24,430 --> 00:13:25,760
I’m going out.

94
00:13:27,620 --> 00:13:28,860
Where are you going?

95
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:34,080
I need to finish writing my novel, just a little more left.

96
00:14:15,370 --> 00:14:16,730
You’re still awake?

97
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:20,110
I’m not sleepy yet.

98
00:14:24,110 --> 00:14:25,840
Did you finish your novel?

99
00:14:27,930 --> 00:14:28,910
Yeah.

100
00:14:43,820 --> 00:14:45,060
What are you doing?

101
00:14:45,570 --> 00:14:46,800
Still not going to bed?

102
00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:50,770
I’m reading “Echoes of Spring.”

103
00:14:51,950 --> 00:14:53,250
Have you ever read it?

104
00:14:54,450 --> 00:14:55,950
I’ve read half of it.

105
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:59,470
My schedule got busy, so I couldn't finish it. Why?

106
00:15:00,870 --> 00:15:02,300
Just wondering.

107
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:08,720
I think Intouch is really talented even though he’s still young.

108
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:11,250
He’s very promising.

109
00:15:11,870 --> 00:15:13,300
Talented ...

110
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:15,550
and promising?

111
00:15:18,670 --> 00:15:22,350
His work has received a lot of praise,

112
00:15:22,670 --> 00:15:24,500
both as a scriptwriter

113
00:15:25,970 --> 00:15:27,320
and novelist.

114
00:15:31,950 --> 00:15:33,100
What about me?

115
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:36,100
Do I lack any talent?

116
00:15:36,420 --> 00:15:38,250
I’m also young and promising.

117
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:41,020
My projects are successful,

118
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:43,370
and I have my own company.

119
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:46,670
I have a lot of fans, too.

120
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:54,200
Yes, you’re amazing.

121
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:57,950
Now get some sleep.

122
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:04,570
I’ll be here beside you.

123
00:16:40,940 --> 00:16:43,860
Great god Shan, something’s happened!

124
00:16:45,910 --> 00:16:49,000
If you click in, you’ll see “The Love Triangle of YS writers.”

125
00:16:56,520 --> 00:17:00,300
Hello, everyone. I’m Ozone, the host of this gossip show.

126
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:02,720
I’m sure you’ve all been following the news about YS.

127
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:05,750
Little Prince Ob-aun of martial arts novels

128
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:08,420
and the talented writer Intouch …

129
00:17:08,420 --> 00:17:11,349
were secretly meeting at a hotel.

130
00:17:11,369 --> 00:17:16,170
Could this be the start of a romance or something immoral?

131
00:17:16,170 --> 00:17:19,050
Now let’s hear from our source.

132
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,119
Hello.

133
00:17:21,369 --> 00:17:23,369
Yes, I’m the one who leaked the news.

134
00:17:23,369 --> 00:17:28,270
Could you share what happened that day?

135
00:17:28,270 --> 00:17:29,770
At the press conference that day …

136
00:17:29,770 --> 00:17:32,570
Excuse me, are you in line?

137
00:17:32,570 --> 00:17:34,950
Oh, no. You can go ahead.

138
00:17:34,950 --> 00:17:36,500
Thank you.

139
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:39,050
Wow, he’s good-looking and kind.

140
00:17:39,450 --> 00:17:44,850
At first, I just thought this guy handsome and nice guy looked familiar,

141
00:17:44,850 --> 00:17:50,000
but I didn’t realize until we went behind the hotel and saw him with Intouch ...

142
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:58,700
that he was Little Prince.

143
00:17:58,700 --> 00:18:02,470
I remember that Intouch’s novel has a character with a name similar to Ob-aun.

144
00:18:02,470 --> 00:18:05,520
Readers like him a lot, but I can’t remember the name.

145
00:18:05,950 --> 00:18:07,450
I think it’s Aun-ai (Warm feeling).

146
00:18:07,450 --> 00:18:11,150
Now let’s look at Ob-aun, whose pen name is Little Prince.

147
00:18:11,150 --> 00:18:15,650
He is famous for writing historical martial arts novels, and has some iconic quotes.

148
00:18:15,650 --> 00:18:19,600
If you check his Instagram, he’s an extrovert and loves cooking.

149
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:21,800
It’s strangely similar, right?

150
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:25,050
The crown prince also loves cooking.

151
00:18:25,050 --> 00:18:30,280
So we agreed that Zhao Yang and Zhao Qian Yu are probably based on Ob-aun.

152
00:18:40,380 --> 00:18:43,650
Love, don’t cry.

153
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:47,500
I’m close to death.

154
00:18:49,630 --> 00:18:54,140
Once I’m gone, there will be no more pain.

155
00:18:57,150 --> 00:18:58,150
No!

156
00:19:00,110 --> 00:19:01,050
Hey!

157
00:19:25,300 --> 00:19:26,410
Finally,

158
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:31,660
we meet again.

159
00:19:33,370 --> 00:19:34,610
Brother ...

160
00:19:36,260 --> 00:19:37,530
I’m sorry.

161
00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:40,480
I never thought …

162
00:19:41,550 --> 00:19:43,530
that this meeting

163
00:19:44,940 --> 00:19:47,440
would be our last.

164
00:19:48,750 --> 00:19:50,210
Remember this,

165
00:19:50,860 --> 00:19:52,480
our sect ...

166
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:55,390
sheds blood,

167
00:19:57,330 --> 00:20:00,910
not tears.

168
00:20:03,030 --> 00:20:05,990
Brother!

169
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:10,480
Brother!

170
00:20:15,810 --> 00:20:20,330
I never imagined that the story of Zhao Qian Yu and Intouch could be this touching.

171
00:20:20,330 --> 00:20:24,550
After writing this far, we can now understand the past events.

172
00:20:24,550 --> 00:20:25,610
Yes.

173
00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:28,530
So, in summary,

174
00:20:28,530 --> 00:20:32,880
Intouch and Ob-aun have known each other for a long time and were very close.

175
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:36,210
But something happened and caused them to drift apart.

176
00:20:36,210 --> 00:20:38,750
After that, they became strangers.

177
00:20:38,750 --> 00:20:41,210
However, Intouch never forgot Ob-aun,

178
00:20:41,210 --> 00:20:45,010
to the point of creating a character based on him.

179
00:20:45,010 --> 00:20:48,550
Intouch probably joined “Deception” project because of Ob-aun.

180
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:53,770
However, now Ob-aun is in a good relationship with Great God Shan.

181
00:20:53,790 --> 00:20:56,350
Intouch might want to reconcile with Ob-aun.

182
00:20:56,480 --> 00:21:00,790
Ob-aun also wants to see Intouch, even though they parted ways for a long time.

183
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:07,930
Feelings of regret, sorrow, and many changes couldn’t be avoided.

184
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:13,240
Finally, we have a special part for everyone.

185
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:17,480
I’d like to leave you with one phrase: "Action speaks louder than words".

186
00:21:32,030 --> 00:21:36,260
Oh, you really answer my call? Feeling better?

187
00:21:37,450 --> 00:21:38,580
What’s up?

188
00:21:39,100 --> 00:21:41,140
Well, did you know?

189
00:21:41,890 --> 00:21:46,630
The fans are gossiping about the YS writers’ love triangle …

190
00:21:46,890 --> 00:21:53,060
of Shi Er Ye, Little Prince, and Mohly.

191
00:21:54,180 --> 00:21:57,540
Nonsense. Who would believe such baseless rumor?

192
00:22:00,290 --> 00:22:02,570
And why wouldn’t they believe it?

193
00:22:03,340 --> 00:22:05,910
You can’t see, right?

194
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:10,630
Let me read you some of the comments.

195
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:18,710
Whoa, this photo is too impressive.

196
00:22:18,940 --> 00:22:22,200
I can write thousands of words of fanfiction from this.

197
00:22:23,290 --> 00:22:30,090
The comment above should definitely write that fic! Please, I’m dying to read it!

198
00:22:30,940 --> 00:22:41,320
I checked Intouch’s Instagram. He liked one of God Shan's comments on a post about Ob-aun’s "Fiery Attire".

199
00:22:42,090 --> 00:22:48,340
If what the original poster said is true, this love triangle situation is heartbreaking.

200
00:22:49,690 --> 00:22:53,890
It’s crazy! Ob-aun has chemistry with everyone.

201
00:22:53,910 --> 00:22:55,910
He looks good with everyone.

202
00:23:02,630 --> 00:23:04,740
Shan, Shan!

203
00:23:06,230 --> 00:23:07,160
Ob-aun.

204
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:08,700
Are you on your phone?

205
00:23:11,050 --> 00:23:12,700
You can see now, right?

206
00:23:14,070 --> 00:23:15,100
Ob-aun.

207
00:23:15,100 --> 00:23:18,630
Why didn’t you tell me? How long have you been lying to me?

208
00:23:20,410 --> 00:23:21,520
Ob-aun.

209
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:24,770
Was it fun playing with my feelings?

210
00:23:27,630 --> 00:23:30,120
Ob-aun, I didn’t mean to …
To what?

211
00:23:30,740 --> 00:23:34,050
Are you happy seeing me as a fool …

212
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:37,830
who knew nothing and just kept worrying about you?

213
00:23:57,780 --> 00:23:59,430
I’m sorry for doing this.

214
00:24:00,650 --> 00:24:03,210
I never meant to play with your feelings.

215
00:24:04,740 --> 00:24:06,230
Then why didn’t you tell me?

216
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:13,450
Why did you hide it from me?

217
00:24:17,900 --> 00:24:19,230
Because I was scared.

218
00:24:23,230 --> 00:24:25,980
Scared that if I told you I could see again,

219
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:31,410
you’d disappear, just like that day.

220
00:24:59,650 --> 00:25:00,780
Shan.

221
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:03,920
Listen to me.

222
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:09,230
Whether you can see or not,

223
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:11,780
I’ll always be with you.

224
00:25:14,780 --> 00:25:16,500
I’ll never leave you.

225
00:25:18,470 --> 00:25:19,980
Because I love you.

226
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:22,560
I love you so freaking much.

227
00:25:52,980 --> 00:25:54,070
Shan ...

228
00:25:56,140 --> 00:25:59,320
It’s okay, I’m right here.

229
00:26:19,140 --> 00:26:20,740
I'm not afraid.

230
00:26:24,670 --> 00:26:26,850
As long as I have you, I fear nothing.

231
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:40,120
What are you doing?

232
00:36:42,300 --> 00:36:43,640
You're awake?

233
00:36:44,780 --> 00:36:46,300
Sleep a little longer.

234
00:36:53,720 --> 00:36:57,380
I can’t, I need to upload “Ballad of the sandstorm”.

235
00:37:00,550 --> 00:37:02,210
Then I’ll help you write it.

236
00:37:07,180 --> 00:37:09,780
No, you can’t help.

237
00:37:12,550 --> 00:37:14,180
Don’t be stubborn.

238
00:37:15,180 --> 00:37:16,700
Go back to sleep.

239
00:37:17,010 --> 00:37:18,580
You can write it later.

240
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:20,500
Please?

241
00:37:20,500 --> 00:37:21,870
I have to work.

242
00:37:21,870 --> 00:37:24,300
Pretty please?

243
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:28,040
Sleep a little more.

244
00:37:57,950 --> 00:37:59,270
That’s enough.

245
00:38:00,810 --> 00:38:02,120
It’s not enough.

246
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:03,980
Enough already.

247
00:38:07,580 --> 00:38:09,210
Shan, stop!

248
00:38:12,410 --> 00:38:13,100
Shan.

249
00:38:13,100 --> 00:38:14,440
You aren’t going to sleep?

250
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:16,900
Fine, fine, I’ll sleep.

251
00:38:36,870 --> 00:38:38,350
What are you writing?

252
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:43,870
The Villain’s strategy guide?

253
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:48,010
Take a look.

254
00:38:51,900 --> 00:38:53,120
Hey!

255
00:38:53,670 --> 00:38:56,120
Did you write about the blindfold scene?

256
00:38:56,840 --> 00:39:00,300
I just borrowed the idea. I didn’t write our story,

257
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:04,120
just blindfolding Duan Ruxing.

258
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:07,120
You can read it for yourself.

259
00:39:19,700 --> 00:39:21,180
Shan.

260
00:39:31,500 --> 00:39:33,640
God Ye is truly a genius.

261
00:39:33,980 --> 00:39:38,100
This scene is brilliant, no wonder he's YS's top writer.

262
00:39:39,900 --> 00:39:44,240
How much 18+ material has God Ye secretly read?

263
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:46,240
He really doesn’t disappoint the readers.

264
00:39:47,550 --> 00:39:51,240
You think he studied this stuff? He clearly practiced it in real life.

265
00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:53,040
Unsend the message!

266
00:39:54,610 --> 00:39:57,670
Shan, your writing made my heart race.

267
00:39:58,750 --> 00:40:02,040
Oh my god, you’ve even made P’Jao Samut’s heart race!

268
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:04,350
It looks like this chapter is a success.

269
00:40:06,040 --> 00:40:10,410
If nobody has issues, then this chapter is finished.

270
00:40:11,350 --> 00:40:12,870
By the way,

271
00:40:13,070 --> 00:40:16,300
has Ob-aun read it yet? Why hasn’t he said anything?

272
00:40:16,740 --> 00:40:19,900
Good question. Is he still with Shan?

273
00:40:29,810 --> 00:40:31,780
Can I pretend to be dead in the chat?

274
00:40:32,120 --> 00:40:33,180
No.

275
00:40:36,070 --> 00:40:39,010
What do you think? Are you satisfied?

276
00:40:39,780 --> 00:40:41,210
Satisfied with what?

277
00:40:41,210 --> 00:40:44,300
The chapter I wrote. Are you satisfied with it?

278
00:40:44,900 --> 00:40:46,410
Well …

279
00:40:47,410 --> 00:40:49,180
I’m quite satisfied.

280
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:51,870
Then I’ll reply for you.

281
00:40:53,270 --> 00:40:55,350
Ob-aun says he's very satisfied.

282
00:40:55,350 --> 00:40:57,100
Hey!

283
00:40:57,100 --> 00:41:00,100
Stop that! Who said I was very satisfied?

284
00:41:00,500 --> 00:41:03,780
I said “quite satisfied”.

285
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:08,900
Just that? Then tell me what I need to fix,

286
00:41:08,900 --> 00:41:10,640
and I’ll fix it now.

287
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:16,440
No, don’t fix.

288
00:41:17,010 --> 00:41:19,040
It seems like you want to fix something.

289
00:41:22,300 --> 00:41:22,950
What?

290
00:41:22,950 --> 00:41:24,040
Let’s fix it?

291
00:41:24,040 --> 00:41:25,240
What?

292
00:41:26,980 --> 00:41:27,780
Shan.

293
00:41:27,780 --> 00:41:29,410
Quite satisfied?

294
00:41:32,840 --> 00:41:34,240
Let me fix it then.

295
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:37,580
Shan … Agh! Let go!

296
00:41:37,780 --> 00:41:38,920
Huh?

297
00:42:03,500 --> 00:42:04,920
You …

298
00:42:08,840 --> 00:42:11,950
Mom, Dad, I’m leaving. Goodbye.

299
00:42:11,950 --> 00:42:14,520
Take care, son.
Safe travels.

300
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:19,350
Good luck.

301
00:42:21,180 --> 00:42:22,580
Goodbye.

302
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:15,780
Let me know when you get home. I’ll be quick.

303
00:43:19,180 --> 00:43:20,900
I really want to kiss you.

304
00:43:29,240 --> 00:43:32,950
Do you think our relationship is moving too fast?

305
00:43:34,610 --> 00:43:37,840
Shan, I just remembered so many things.

306
00:43:39,010 --> 00:43:44,300
San Yao, the swing, chocolate cake ...

307
00:43:44,980 --> 00:43:47,270
and the time you put headphones on me.

308
00:43:50,270 --> 00:43:52,300
I can’t remember everything,

309
00:43:53,750 --> 00:43:57,840
but I know I was so happy back then.

310
00:44:00,010 --> 00:44:03,100
Shan, even without those 10 years,

311
00:44:03,380 --> 00:44:07,670
I believe if we met, I’d still fall in love with you.

312
00:44:12,440 --> 00:44:15,350
So, in our relationship,

313
00:44:16,150 --> 00:44:20,100
there’s no such thing as too fast or too slow—only destiny.

314
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:31,470
There are so many people here!

315
00:44:37,750 --> 00:44:39,500
I see no problem.

316
00:44:50,010 --> 00:44:51,900
There are a lot of people.

317
00:44:52,120 --> 00:44:53,870
I’m cool with that.

318
00:45:14,270 --> 00:45:15,380
Alright.

319
00:45:16,100 --> 00:45:18,830
Sure.

320
00:45:20,740 --> 00:45:22,510
I'll call you back later.

321
00:45:24,470 --> 00:45:26,150
What a small world.

322
00:45:26,320 --> 00:45:29,300
I’m 22 this year.

323
00:45:29,610 --> 00:45:31,380
I just graduated.

324
00:45:33,380 --> 00:45:35,210
And I’ve never had a boyfriend.

325
00:45:37,340 --> 00:45:39,090
You're really something.

326
00:45:39,340 --> 00:45:46,260
Changing my editor without telling me, and hiding from me like the plague.

327
00:45:46,490 --> 00:45:50,030
Now you’re on a date?

328
00:45:59,070 --> 00:46:01,010
Who’s that? Is this your friend?

329
00:46:01,550 --> 00:46:03,750
Why don’t you introduce her to me?

330
00:46:11,210 --> 00:46:15,240
Director
Nathawat Piyanonpong

331
00:46:15,520 --> 00:46:19,470
If you want fans to ship you, you need to be more mysterious.

332
00:46:19,470 --> 00:46:21,270
This plushie is so cute.

333
00:46:21,720 --> 00:46:23,240
You’re such a kid.

334
00:46:23,240 --> 00:46:25,180
When I’m with you, I’m like a little kid.

00:46:25,180 --> 00:46:27,810
