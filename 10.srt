2
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:23,280
Alright.

3
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,810
Sure.

4
00:00:28,670 --> 00:00:30,240
I'll call you back later.

5
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:34,050
What a small world.

6
00:00:34,220 --> 00:00:37,200
I’m 22 this year.

7
00:00:37,510 --> 00:00:39,280
I just graduated.

8
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:43,110
And I’ve never had a boyfriend.

9
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:46,980
You're really something.

10
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:54,150
Changing my editor without telling me, and hiding from me like the plague.

11
00:00:54,380 --> 00:00:57,920
Now you’re on a date?

12
00:01:06,970 --> 00:01:08,910
Who’s that? Is this your friend?

13
00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:11,650
Why don’t you introduce her to me?

14
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:14,740
What are you doing here?

15
00:01:18,220 --> 00:01:21,600
Never mind, just let go of me first.

16
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:23,080
I won’t.

17
00:01:23,450 --> 00:01:28,740
You left me alone, and now you’re secretly … matchmaking.

18
00:01:29,910 --> 00:01:31,200
You’re just …

19
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:32,570
What the heck?

20
00:01:32,570 --> 00:01:37,600
Editor, am I interrupting your time with your friend?

21
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:40,450
Or maybe we can reschedule for another day?

22
00:01:42,850 --> 00:01:44,140
Editor?

23
00:01:44,140 --> 00:01:49,509
Yes, the editor and I are having a job interview.

24
00:01:53,910 --> 00:01:58,800
Here’s my resume, are you free to review it right now?

25
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:09,280
Thank you very much. I’ll be in touch.

26
00:02:10,310 --> 00:02:11,450
Thank you.

27
00:02:30,170 --> 00:02:31,620
Matchmaking?

28
00:02:32,510 --> 00:02:39,020
Ozone, I didn’t know your vocabulary expand this much.

29
00:02:39,220 --> 00:02:41,020
I’ve been learning from P’Jao Samut.

30
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:43,680
Learning is an endless process, after all.

31
00:02:46,170 --> 00:02:51,620
I still have to interview several more people, you can head back first.

32
00:02:54,880 --> 00:03:00,080
Your new editor, Yin, is someone I personally trained.

33
00:03:00,510 --> 00:03:03,910
She’s nice and talented, so you don’t need to worry.

34
00:03:06,050 --> 00:03:08,310
I’m not used to it. I don’t want to change.

35
00:03:08,310 --> 00:03:12,000
What? It’s not like an office coworker.

36
00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:14,970
You will see each other only once or twice a year.

37
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:20,600
Besides, I’m handling everything in the company.

38
00:03:21,710 --> 00:03:23,740
So I’m very busy.

39
00:03:25,370 --> 00:03:27,310
I don’t want to change my editor.

40
00:03:27,310 --> 00:03:30,850
I’ve chosen the best editor in YS for you.

41
00:03:30,850 --> 00:03:34,280
Aren’t you the best editor at YS?

42
00:03:34,770 --> 00:03:37,600
Is this reaction necessary? It’s just changing editor.

43
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:41,200
You don’t respect me.

44
00:03:42,740 --> 00:03:48,020
How? Others only get three days’ notice when changing editors,

45
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:52,110
but I’ve given you plenty of time.

46
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:58,800
I’m really not used to it, and I don’t want the change.

47
00:04:03,850 --> 00:04:07,220
How about this, you wait in my room.

48
00:04:07,740 --> 00:04:11,170
I’ll talk to you after I finish here.

49
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,310
Please, have a seat.

50
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:41,400
Pharinyakorn Khansawa

Director
Nathawat Piyanonpong

60
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,250
Why didn’t you dry your hair first?

61
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:14,570
Ozone.

62
00:06:14,570 --> 00:06:17,140
Hmm, I know. Just let me finish this game.

63
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:44,020
Hey, be gentle! Are you drying my hair or peeling my scalp?

64
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:50,620
Then do it yourself.

65
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:52,050
(Game Over!)

66
00:06:52,050 --> 00:06:54,370
What’s wrong with you?
No, what’s wrong with you?

67
00:06:56,970 --> 00:07:02,220
I thought you’d come home for dinner, so I ordered the roast duck you like.

68
00:07:05,450 --> 00:07:07,340
Who told you I like roast duck?

69
00:07:07,340 --> 00:07:11,510
Don’t you remember? The first time we met, you treated me to roast duck.

70
00:07:21,170 --> 00:07:23,480
It’s the restaurant’s signature dish.

71
00:07:24,140 --> 00:07:25,710
You should try it.

72
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:28,570
Well, I won’t hold back then.

73
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:48,020
My novel ‘Four O’clock Sharp’ is based on wormhole and time overlap theories.

74
00:07:48,020 --> 00:07:52,420
The male lead, Qin Rui, can see everything happening in another world

75
00:07:52,420 --> 00:07:56,000
but can’t touch or hear anything.

76
00:07:56,140 --> 00:07:58,880
It’s just like watching a projection.

77
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:08,510
In my next novel, I plan to write about …

78
00:08:08,740 --> 00:08:10,740
the end of the universe.

79
00:08:12,220 --> 00:08:15,620
By the way, have you followed the AI hot topic lately?

80
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:21,400
I also have some inspiration from Cthulhu mythology and …

81
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:23,400
Do you know what’s wrong with your novel?

82
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:25,220
Huh?

83
00:08:25,220 --> 00:08:30,250
The genre isn’t popular, the writing style isn’t smooth, and the pacing is slow.

84
00:08:30,540 --> 00:08:33,630
I read 3 chapters, and it hasn’t even gotten to the main plot.

85
00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:37,280
Also, did you learn Thai from a physical education teacher?

86
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:42,539
The grammar’s all over the place.

87
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:52,250
If I’m so bad, then why do you want to sign me?

88
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:15,080
Maybe because I saw a little glimmer of hope in you.

89
00:10:19,710 --> 00:10:21,600
You deserve it.

90
00:10:32,370 --> 00:10:33,620
I’m sorry.

91
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:37,570
for saying those things.

92
00:10:37,940 --> 00:10:39,340
Oh my god.

93
00:10:39,370 --> 00:10:44,050
When you insulted me like a dog, you never apologized.

94
00:10:47,020 --> 00:10:49,600
Well, because that was your fault.

95
00:10:50,770 --> 00:10:55,710
Just now, I was in a bad mood … so it’s my fault.

96
00:10:57,510 --> 00:10:59,340
And why were you upset?

97
00:11:03,510 --> 00:11:08,250
Well … you washed your hair, and the water dripped onto the floor.

98
00:11:08,910 --> 00:11:11,940
I’m a clean freak. It bothered me.

99
00:11:13,020 --> 00:11:17,770
Are you sure? I’m the one who washed your dishes.

100
00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:26,740
Have you been drinking today?

101
00:11:34,570 --> 00:11:36,170
Want some red wine?

102
00:11:55,020 --> 00:11:56,110
Ozone.

103
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:03,450
About your editor change … I made the decision myself.

104
00:12:05,450 --> 00:12:06,620
Why?

105
00:12:07,540 --> 00:12:11,080
No particular reason, it’s just part of the job.

106
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Blankets are in the closet. Grab one if you need it.

107
00:12:17,450 --> 00:12:20,480
Nah, that’s a hassle. I’ll just sleep with you.

108
00:12:21,850 --> 00:12:22,940
What?

109
00:12:22,940 --> 00:12:25,710
Your bed is wide enough. Share it with me.

110
00:12:34,850 --> 00:12:37,850
Fine, you sleep here. I’ll sleep in the guest room.

111
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:55,600
Unbelievable. You were all sweet when asking for manuscript submissions,

112
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:59,050
but now you act like you disgust me.

113
00:13:10,510 --> 00:13:12,540
Alright, everyone! Cheers!

114
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:16,220
Cheers!

115
00:13:20,340 --> 00:13:22,020
Bottoms up.

116
00:13:22,710 --> 00:13:23,800
Bottoms up?

117
00:13:25,110 --> 00:13:27,080
Yes, P’Jao Samut.

118
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:33,170
Bottoms up, bottoms up!

119
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,510
P’Jao Samut, you’re amazing!

120
00:14:02,510 --> 00:14:05,280
Why are you sitting here all alone?

121
00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:09,050
I’m avoiding Sin. He’s trying to get me drunk.

122
00:14:14,510 --> 00:14:16,280
Merry Christmas.

123
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:21,140
Merry Christmas.

124
00:14:22,910 --> 00:14:25,000
I’ve got a Christmas present for you.

125
00:14:33,710 --> 00:14:35,370
I’ll open it now.

126
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:45,570
It’s to get you to submit your manuscript faster.

127
00:15:44,250 --> 00:15:45,600
You …

128
00:15:46,050 --> 00:15:50,220
Whatever I did wrong before, I apologize.

129
00:15:51,970 --> 00:15:53,740
Please don’t be mad at me.

130
00:15:54,570 --> 00:15:56,570
This is just who I am.

131
00:16:00,110 --> 00:16:02,020
Can you not change my editor?

132
00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:21,600
So just because you’re uncomfortable with it, I have to be your editor for life?

133
00:16:29,310 --> 00:16:32,540
If you don’t want to be my editor, then don’t.

134
00:16:33,620 --> 00:16:36,280
But can you stop being hot and cold with me?

135
00:16:37,170 --> 00:16:39,510
We were fine before, weren’t we?

136
00:16:45,540 --> 00:16:50,420
Come on, just say what I did wrong.

137
00:16:58,220 --> 00:16:59,650
What do you want me to say?

138
00:17:01,540 --> 00:17:02,940
The truth.

139
00:17:04,420 --> 00:17:08,740
If you don’t care about me anymore, just say it.

140
00:17:13,079 --> 00:17:15,140
You want me to say that …

141
00:17:17,940 --> 00:17:20,220
I have inappropriate thoughts about you?

142
00:17:23,079 --> 00:17:27,000
That I care about every little thing you do?

143
00:17:30,110 --> 00:17:31,600
To say that …

144
00:17:35,050 --> 00:17:37,800
I don’t know when I started liking you?

145
00:17:40,170 --> 00:17:44,170
To say that, in Chiang Mai,

146
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:52,220
I couldn’t control my heartbeat when I was with you?

147
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:12,740
Or to say that when you were with Min,

148
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:15,770
I couldn’t help but feel jealous?

149
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:23,000
To say that at my nephew’s wedding,

150
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:26,310
I couldn’t resist stealing a kiss from you?

151
00:18:30,420 --> 00:18:33,910
I don’t want to complicate things. I don’t want to get involved with you.

152
00:18:35,420 --> 00:18:36,820
I don’t want to love you.

153
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,570
But I also want you to stay with me.

154
00:18:53,820 --> 00:18:55,000
I …

155
00:18:57,020 --> 00:18:58,450
I didn’t know.

156
00:18:59,650 --> 00:19:01,220
Yes, you didn’t know.

157
00:19:05,250 --> 00:19:09,570
You never talked … like this before.

158
00:19:34,220 --> 00:19:35,880
I’m saying it now.

159
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:40,110
Do you know how hard it’s been to hold back?

160
00:19:40,250 --> 00:19:41,540
So ...

161
00:19:44,340 --> 00:19:47,420
Can I be the male lead in your real life?

162
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:55,850
I want to keep you safe and near, standing by your side forever here.

163
00:19:55,850 --> 00:19:59,480
Can I be the one for you?

164
00:21:03,650 --> 00:21:10,020
Whisper in my dreams about the feelings I’ve kept inside,

165
00:21:10,020 --> 00:21:15,650
Tell you softly, of the love I cannot hide.

166
00:21:15,650 --> 00:21:18,800
I want to keep you safe,

167
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:25,110
So you can write more chapters of our fate.

168
00:21:28,050 --> 00:21:34,000
Can you show me? Please, let me know.

169
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:38,970
So we can understand each other and grow.

170
00:25:42,020 --> 00:25:44,000
I’m sorry.

171
00:25:46,820 --> 00:25:48,310
I mistook you for someone else.

172
00:26:46,310 --> 00:26:49,970
'An Unfamiliar Spring Breeze that Stirs the Curtain’s Veil'

173
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:02,540
God Ye, I’ve got something cool to suggest.

174
00:27:02,540 --> 00:27:06,850
If you want fans to ship you, you need to be mysterious.

175
00:27:07,140 --> 00:27:09,310
How?

176
00:27:09,310 --> 00:27:12,310
To create a buzz, you need a hashtag.

177
00:27:14,450 --> 00:27:18,000
How about #CPGuardWar?

178
00:27:18,370 --> 00:27:20,540
Do I really have to do that?
Yep.

179
00:27:20,770 --> 00:27:23,800
First, do you have any couple items?

180
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:28,200
Like matching clothes, shoes, watches.

181
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:30,450
Anything from the same collection.

182
00:27:31,050 --> 00:27:32,820
We live in the same house.

183
00:27:34,620 --> 00:27:38,000
In five minutes, I need to see your couple items.

184
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:46,850
Couple items, huh?

185
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:05,310
What’s up, my karma?

186
00:28:05,420 --> 00:28:07,740
Finally remembered me?

187
00:28:07,740 --> 00:28:10,770
Akin, I need your help.

188
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:26,450
What could it be?

189
00:28:30,420 --> 00:28:32,280
This plushie is so cute.

190
00:28:37,940 --> 00:28:42,880
Akin sent one to you, and the other one has already been delivered to your condo.

191
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:44,710
Thank you so much.

192
00:29:10,310 --> 00:29:13,480
Hello, did you receive your gift yet?

193
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:15,970
You have a sharp instinct.

194
00:29:16,140 --> 00:29:18,200
Why did you send me a plushie?

195
00:29:18,710 --> 00:29:23,200
I haven’t had time lately, so I just wanted to send you something.

196
00:29:23,450 --> 00:29:28,050
Thought it was cute, so I had Akin send it to you.

197
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:30,170
Why the rush?

198
00:29:30,170 --> 00:29:34,970
You could’ve waited until you were back. No need to bother Akin.

199
00:29:34,970 --> 00:29:37,080
I didn’t want to wait.

200
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:39,680
And it was on Akin’s way anyway.

201
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:43,620
Well, I really love it.

202
00:29:45,450 --> 00:29:48,570
If you love it, make sure to post about it.

203
00:29:50,570 --> 00:29:53,310
Got it, I’ll post right now.

204
00:29:53,310 --> 00:29:55,650
Good luck with work.

205
00:29:56,970 --> 00:29:58,310
Thanks.

206
00:30:00,540 --> 00:30:02,710
Where should I take the photo?

207
00:30:19,820 --> 00:30:22,080
I can’t wait to see you.

208
00:30:27,140 --> 00:30:28,340
Hm.

209
00:30:29,540 --> 00:30:34,650
Great job, God Shan, but you posted just a small hint, will anyone notice? Want me to repost it?

210
00:30:34,710 --> 00:30:36,050
No need.

211
00:30:38,250 --> 00:30:43,140
5, 4, 3, 2, 1.

212
00:30:55,570 --> 00:30:59,220
Why’d you delete it? Did you just repost?

213
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:01,170
This time, no plushie.

214
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:03,600
You hid Ob-aun’s eating shrimp post too?

215
00:31:05,850 --> 00:31:10,050
You’re really controlling the narrative. So impressive, God Shan.

216
00:31:12,250 --> 00:31:14,570
Just posting what I want.

217
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:18,850
Just you wait, you’ll be trending in 30 seconds.

218
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:27,970
Selling us the ship of Shan and Little Prince?

219
00:31:27,970 --> 00:31:30,140
It’s just matching plushies.

220
00:31:30,140 --> 00:31:32,140
I didn’t expect this would trend on Twitter.

221
00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:37,740
I’ve never seen Shan act so flustered.

222
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:43,370
I just started shipping Ob-aun and Intouch, but this pairing feels more real.

223
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:45,910
The way they look at each other is everything.

224
00:31:47,220 --> 00:31:51,770
Doesn’t anyone else feel like Ob-aun and Shan’s posts seem like they’re talking to each other?

225
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:55,620
“I can’t wait to see you.” “Hm.”

226
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:22,340
It keeps ringing.

227
00:32:33,020 --> 00:32:35,000
Could someone please explain?

228
00:32:43,910 --> 00:32:45,880
I just posted on IG.

229
00:32:46,510 --> 00:32:48,190
And I liked the post.

230
00:32:48,940 --> 00:32:51,620
I saw Ozone liked it, so I liked it too.

231
00:32:52,110 --> 00:32:53,820
I just went with the flow.

232
00:32:54,420 --> 00:32:57,250
They liked it, so I did too.

233
00:32:58,020 --> 00:33:01,050
Whoa, P'Jao Samut, you've improved.

234
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:03,050
What kind of logic is this?

235
00:33:04,140 --> 00:33:05,760
From my experience,

236
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:09,740
people will surely accuse Shan of wanting attention.

237
00:33:11,650 --> 00:33:15,480
But it’s fine since the three of us liked the post, he is safe.

238
00:33:16,250 --> 00:33:18,850
I’m a loyal friend, just so you know.

239
00:33:19,420 --> 00:33:21,280
More like a frenemy.

240
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:41,790
Shan, what’s this all about?

241
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:43,160
Ob-aun.

242
00:33:43,250 --> 00:33:44,940
Don’t call my name.

243
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:47,080
Answer me, what’s this about?

244
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:51,450
When you wrote ‘Death Dance’,

245
00:33:51,910 --> 00:33:54,850
the male lead liked Inthanin flower. What does that mean?

246
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:56,650
Are you referring to Fang Ying?

247
00:33:57,710 --> 00:33:59,280
Did I write something like that?

248
00:33:59,310 --> 00:34:02,190
Yeah, in chapter 32, second line from the bottom.

249
00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:04,590
There’s no hidden meaning.

250
00:34:04,590 --> 00:34:08,540
I was researching flowers with meanings of stability,

251
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:10,190
and I found it.

252
00:34:14,050 --> 00:34:18,679
I just saw a post saying you and Intouch have a deep relationship that’s hard to forget.

253
00:34:19,050 --> 00:34:20,139
Me and who?

254
00:34:20,139 --> 00:34:25,020
When you met after the press conference, someone snapped a photo of you two.

255
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:29,139
They said the way you looked at each other was something.

256
00:34:29,420 --> 00:34:33,679
They also said that the male leads in two of his novels are based on you.

257
00:34:35,340 --> 00:34:39,480
And your male lead likes Inthanin flower because it sounds like Intouch.

258
00:34:39,909 --> 00:34:42,190
The fans even wrote fanfics about you two.

259
00:34:43,850 --> 00:34:47,219
Hey, listen carefully.

260
00:34:48,620 --> 00:34:51,449
The one Intouch likes is you.

261
00:34:54,199 --> 00:34:56,480
But the person I like is you.

262
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:01,760
You’re such a kid.

263
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:06,110
It’s because of you. With you, I feel like a little kid again.

264
00:35:07,020 --> 00:35:09,710
But I’m not giving in when it comes to bed activities.

265
00:35:11,650 --> 00:35:13,540
Don’t even think.

266
00:35:15,450 --> 00:35:18,880
Let me see what the fans are saying.

267
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:26,620
There really is Ob-aun and Intouch pairing.

268
00:35:26,820 --> 00:35:31,020
Inthanin flower means Intouch? I’m the writer and didn’t even know that.

269
00:35:32,190 --> 00:35:34,850
Forget it. Let’s head back to change clothes, and go out.

270
00:35:36,250 --> 00:35:37,850
Hurry up.

271
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:39,400
Carry me.

272
00:35:39,420 --> 00:35:41,220
No, I’m sulking.

273
00:35:43,190 --> 00:35:44,880
I’m not going to comfort you.

274
00:35:45,220 --> 00:35:46,360
Shan, wait.

275
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:30,540
Hello, I’m here to deliver your food. Could you please open the door?

276
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:09,080
Ob-aun.

277
00:37:09,080 --> 00:37:12,280
What’s up? Can’t write?

278
00:37:13,110 --> 00:37:15,560
When did you start liking Shan?

279
00:37:15,620 --> 00:37:19,650
Ozone, what’s on your mind?

280
00:37:22,850 --> 00:37:26,220
Nothing, I just want to know.

281
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:35,710
Are you asking me to confirm if what you’re feeling is romantic love?

282
00:37:37,570 --> 00:37:42,220
Actually, there’s a simple test that works for both men and women.

283
00:37:45,310 --> 00:37:46,480
What is it?

284
00:37:47,940 --> 00:37:51,650
Have you touched him yet?

285
00:37:53,020 --> 00:37:55,940
Like … Holding hands,

286
00:37:57,540 --> 00:37:58,740
Hugging,

287
00:38:00,710 --> 00:38:02,510
Or kissing, something like that.

288
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:06,640
What? Who’d do that?

289
00:38:06,810 --> 00:38:08,520
Just give it a try.

290
00:38:08,710 --> 00:38:12,340
And see if you feel uncomfortable.

291
00:38:13,080 --> 00:38:15,170
Your body won’t lie to you.

292
00:38:15,620 --> 00:38:20,220
But even if you’re fine, that doesn’t always mean you like him.

293
00:38:20,740 --> 00:38:24,850
Ozone, this isn’t like writing a novel.

294
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:32,880
Do you really think adults who know everything wouldn’t know if they’re in love with someone?

295
00:38:37,620 --> 00:38:40,450
I think you already have your answer.

296
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:12,440
The congee this morning was delicious.

297
00:39:22,570 --> 00:39:25,480
When are you going to ask me to be your boyfriend?

298
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:31,580
What?

299
00:40:55,100 --> 00:40:57,750
This is the pen you always carry with you.

300
00:40:59,750 --> 00:41:01,440
What do you mean by that?

301
00:41:01,610 --> 00:41:03,380
What do you think?

302
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:12,720
Whenever I mess up, you always know right away.

303
00:41:13,640 --> 00:41:16,720
But when it comes to stuff like this, why can’t you figure it out?

304
00:41:17,610 --> 00:41:22,750
Yesterday you said you wanted to be my male lead.

305
00:41:22,950 --> 00:41:24,550
So …

306
00:41:24,670 --> 00:41:29,440
Come write your story in my real life.

307
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:34,550
Let me be part of every chapter in your stories.

308
00:41:34,550 --> 00:41:39,840
You’re the one who inspires me to keep writing.

309
00:41:41,550 --> 00:41:44,610
I don’t care, I’m posting on IG.

310
00:41:45,100 --> 00:41:48,010
I’ve thought about it for a while that if I ever get a boyfriend,

311
00:41:49,010 --> 00:41:53,440
I’m going to, uh, like, um …

312
00:41:53,610 --> 00:41:55,150
I’m going to post on IG.

313
00:41:59,150 --> 00:42:00,440
Boyfriend?

314
00:42:14,340 --> 00:42:17,650
This writer is in love, and will not update for 3 days.

315
00:42:23,720 --> 00:42:25,210
I love you.

316
00:42:32,520 --> 00:42:34,500
I love you too.

317
00:42:38,380 --> 00:42:41,240
Hugging my boyfriend.

318
00:42:41,240 --> 00:42:43,040
I can’t breathe.

319
00:42:47,100 --> 00:42:48,980
Don’t you have a meeting today?

320
00:42:51,180 --> 00:42:52,640
I’m lazy.

321
00:42:54,320 --> 00:42:59,840
Look at you, spinning around like that, making funny faces.

322
00:42:59,840 --> 00:43:01,810
You’re acting cutesy.

323
00:43:06,070 --> 00:43:08,240
I just want to be with you.

324
00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:10,980
And I’m right here, aren’t I?

325
00:43:20,780 --> 00:43:21,980
What’s up?

326
00:43:23,470 --> 00:43:25,870
It’s time for the meeting, Mr. President.

327
00:43:31,500 --> 00:43:34,670
Play something while you wait for me.

328
00:43:35,070 --> 00:43:37,350
If anything comes up, you can call me anytime.

329
00:43:37,350 --> 00:43:38,610
Sure.

330
00:43:44,580 --> 00:43:47,270
Hurry off to the meeting.

331
00:43:47,580 --> 00:43:50,980
Come on, just wrap it up quickly.

332
00:44:02,100 --> 00:44:05,980
Hey, you’re the new assistant, right?

333
00:44:05,980 --> 00:44:08,610
Come help make coffee and serve it in the meeting room.

334
00:44:08,610 --> 00:44:09,580
Me?

335
00:44:09,580 --> 00:44:10,410
Come on.

336
00:44:10,410 --> 00:44:11,410
Alright.

337
00:44:13,380 --> 00:44:18,950
Mr. President, our KPI for the second quarter has exceeded the set target.

338
00:44:19,270 --> 00:44:23,300
As for the new project in the third quarter, we’re gradually moving forward with it.

339
00:44:24,270 --> 00:44:26,870
What’s the investment direction for the next quarter?

340
00:44:27,100 --> 00:44:28,980
For the third quarter,

341
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:32,410
we will still focus primarily on emerging businesses.

342
00:44:32,410 --> 00:44:37,270
As for traditional businesses, we will gradually promote them in order.

343
00:44:41,310 --> 00:44:44,400
Wow, I’ve never seen Shan this focused on work.

344
00:44:44,450 --> 00:44:47,710
He looks so smart in a suit. It’s giving off major businessman vibe.

345
00:44:54,500 --> 00:44:55,840
Wait.

346
00:44:56,010 --> 00:44:58,900
You stay here and help me take some notes.

347
00:44:59,580 --> 00:45:00,640
Me?

348
00:45:02,500 --> 00:45:09,550
My heart has been discovered by you once again.

349
00:45:10,810 --> 00:45:19,410
Stop being so cute, or no matter how much I hide, you’ll find it anyway.

350
00:45:30,470 --> 00:45:33,920
I think we should focus more on traditional businesses next.

351
00:45:33,920 --> 00:45:36,410
Eastern culture is booming right now.

352
00:45:36,410 --> 00:45:40,040
And customers are starting to show interest in many traditional brands.

353
00:45:50,070 --> 00:45:51,870
Have you written that down?

354
00:45:52,070 --> 00:45:53,580
Yes, sir.

355
00:45:53,580 --> 00:45:59,180
How can I concentrate on taking notes if we’re holding hands?

356
00:46:09,040 --> 00:46:10,320
Mr. President.

357
00:46:10,320 --> 00:46:15,440
We will prepare an investment plan for the third quarter and present it soon.

358
00:46:17,070 --> 00:46:18,720
Then that’s all for today.

359
00:46:18,720 --> 00:46:22,150
Okay, everyone, we’ll end the meeting here.

360
00:46:22,150 --> 00:46:24,300
I’ll take care of the rest.

361
00:46:24,300 --> 00:46:26,780
Feel free to leave the meeting room.

362
00:46:27,470 --> 00:46:28,780
Please.

363
00:46:37,520 --> 00:46:38,920
Hey.

364
00:46:38,920 --> 00:46:41,350
What?
There were so many people around.

365
00:46:43,180 --> 00:46:44,980
There’s no one here now.

366
00:46:46,300 --> 00:46:48,410
Just drink your coffee.

367
00:46:49,610 --> 00:46:50,950
What if I don’t want to?

368
00:47:41,100 --> 00:47:42,610
What are you playing at?

369
00:47:43,350 --> 00:47:45,410
Is it the president and his secretary?

370
00:47:51,380 --> 00:47:55,270
It’s because your employee got me wrong.

371
00:47:59,070 --> 00:48:00,720
I read your new novel.

372
00:48:01,700 --> 00:48:03,670
There’s a line I really liked.

373
00:48:04,380 --> 00:48:08,270
“Shan’s gaze is like moonlight shining through the depths of a lake,

374
00:48:08,700 --> 00:48:13,640
Clear and sparkling like fine liquor, enchanting people.”

375
00:48:17,470 --> 00:48:18,780
You …

376
00:48:21,150 --> 00:48:22,700
You’re quite full of yourself.

377
00:48:23,440 --> 00:48:25,010
You’re mistaken.

378
00:48:25,980 --> 00:48:28,320
What I meant was,

379
00:48:28,640 --> 00:48:31,700
that’s how I look at you.

380
00:48:41,010 --> 00:48:42,700
Take me out on a date first.

381
00:48:44,380 --> 00:48:45,670
Sure.

382
00:48:46,300 --> 00:48:48,640
But after we go out, you have to come home with me.

383
00:48:50,100 --> 00:48:51,470
To Bangkok?

384
00:48:52,780 --> 00:48:54,210
I have a house here.

385
00:48:55,810 --> 00:48:57,410
Then why stay at a hotel?

386
00:48:57,410 --> 00:49:00,700
Well, I sleep for free since I’m the owner.

387
00:49:00,700 --> 00:49:02,410
Oh.

388
00:49:03,470 --> 00:49:07,380
But today I want to stay at home with you. I want a change of scenery.

389
00:49:11,780 --> 00:49:13,070
Sounds good.

390
00:49:18,700 --> 00:49:19,980
Wait.

391
00:49:53,900 --> 00:50:00,900
Is there anywhere I can hide these feelings?

392
00:50:02,070 --> 00:50:08,320
It’s hard to escape when you’re holding me so tight.

393
00:50:08,320 --> 00:50:12,720
No matter how I try to hide, you always find it.

394
00:50:12,870 --> 00:50:16,920
I wanna hear my happy darling when I’m with you.

395
00:50:16,920 --> 00:50:22,550
When we’re close, I let my heart slip away.

396
00:50:22,550 --> 00:50:25,700
What should I do?

397
00:50:26,470 --> 00:50:27,950
Could you kiss me?

398
00:50:28,720 --> 00:50:35,380
My heart has been discovered by you once again.

399
00:50:37,070 --> 00:50:45,720
Stop being so cute, or no matter how much I hide, you’ll find it anyway.

400
00:50:53,550 --> 00:50:59,870
Would you be able to hide it if you were me?

401
00:51:01,380 --> 00:51:07,870
I wonder how you will hide the butterflies.

402
00:51:07,870 --> 00:51:12,180
No matter how I try to hide, you always find it.

403
00:51:12,380 --> 00:51:16,150
I wanna hear my happy darling when I’m with you.

404
00:51:16,150 --> 00:51:22,180
When we’re close, I let my heart slip away.

405
00:51:22,180 --> 00:51:25,210
What should I do?

406
00:52:32,470 --> 00:52:33,910
Why are you looking at me?

407
00:52:34,780 --> 00:52:35,840
Nothing.

408
00:52:37,150 --> 00:52:39,410
I’m just enchanted by your charm.

409
00:52:42,380 --> 00:52:46,920
I want to play a game of the fierce president

410
00:52:50,210 --> 00:52:52,070
and his secretary.

411
00:53:05,720 --> 00:53:10,950
At 9 PM, President Shan arrives at the secretary Ob-aun’s house

412
00:53:12,410 --> 00:53:14,550
to make a deal.

413
00:53:15,440 --> 00:53:19,870
A) Secretary Ob-aun feels it’s too late and refuses.

414
00:53:21,900 --> 00:53:26,070
B) There’s a sudden loud noise from inside the house,

415
00:53:26,780 --> 00:53:28,950
as if something has fallen.

416
00:53:30,750 --> 00:53:31,900
A.

417
00:53:36,550 --> 00:53:39,320
Secretary Ob-aun refuses President Shan.

418
00:53:41,580 --> 00:53:44,210
President Shan feels very sad,

419
00:53:47,580 --> 00:53:49,440
so he …

420
00:53:57,840 --> 00:54:02,950
A) Takes out his phone and orders delivery.

421
00:54:08,010 --> 00:54:12,010
B) Takes out his phone to read the news.

422
00:54:17,920 --> 00:54:19,640
Still A.

423
00:54:23,700 --> 00:54:27,350
President Shan orders Ob-aun’s favorite pizza.

424
00:54:27,350 --> 00:54:33,010
30 minutes pass, and a delivery man knocks on Ob-aun’s door.

425
00:54:34,670 --> 00:54:38,840
A) Ob-aun says it’s not his

426
00:54:40,040 --> 00:54:42,180
and sends the delivery man away.

427
00:54:42,610 --> 00:54:44,010
B)

428
00:54:45,920 --> 00:54:48,320
President Shan keeps it for himself.

429
00:54:51,150 --> 00:54:53,010
I’m not falling for your tricks.

430
00:54:53,470 --> 00:54:54,700
B.

431
00:54:55,500 --> 00:54:58,410
The President ordered it, so he should eat it.

432
00:55:16,800 --> 00:55:18,230
Are you full?

433
00:55:28,840 --> 00:55:33,610
President Shan has eaten his fill and suddenly remembers he has a spare key.

434
00:55:37,070 --> 00:55:39,900
He finds the spare key and opens the door.

435
00:55:40,980 --> 00:55:42,300
A)

436
00:55:43,300 --> 00:55:48,670
President Shan is very angry and kisses Ob-aun once.

437
00:55:49,750 --> 00:55:50,950
B)

438
00:55:52,100 --> 00:55:57,120
President Shan is very angry and kisses Ob-aun twice.

439
00:55:59,610 --> 00:56:00,840
C)

440
00:56:03,410 --> 00:56:05,700
President Shan flirts with Ob-aun.

441
00:56:07,440 --> 00:56:13,010
Secretary Ob-aun can’t take it anymore, so he kisses the President three times.

442
00:56:41,070 --> 00:56:43,410
Secretary Ob-aun is so happy

443
00:56:45,100 --> 00:56:47,440
that he wants to do something.

444
00:56:56,950 --> 00:57:03,410
But the choice is up to President Shan.

445
00:57:05,470 --> 00:57:07,410
The choice …

446
00:57:09,010 --> 00:57:14,670
depends on how President Shan will write it.

447
00:57:23,070 --> 00:57:26,920
My choice is … I’m ready.

448
01:02:03,680 --> 01:02:07,450
Director
Nathawat Piyanonpong

449
01:02:07,940 --> 01:02:11,170
You all know I’m getting married next Saturday, right?

450
01:02:11,170 --> 01:02:14,800
Don’t worry, P’Jao Samut, we will definitely attend your wedding.

451
01:02:14,800 --> 01:02:20,310
I promise we’ll be the best-looking groomsmen in history.

452
01:02:20,570 --> 01:02:21,800
What are you doing?

453
01:02:21,940 --> 01:02:24,080
This is part of the wedding preparations.

454
01:02:24,250 --> 01:02:28,400
Once you finish writing the new chapter, you can log in and upload it yourself.

455
01:02:29,770 --> 01:02:32,650
Oh, it’s a disaster.
