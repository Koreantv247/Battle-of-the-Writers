2
00:00:13,710 --> 00:00:20,420
Just a glimpse of her graceful figure, and you can tell she’s as divine as a heavenly goddess.

3
00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:25,000
Do you know why the princess could remember the prince?

4
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,970
Because ...

5
00:00:26,970 --> 00:00:30,680
he knocked three times and she knocked back twice.

6
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:33,170
Wait, how do you know that?

7
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:35,850
Well, I watched it before.

8
00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:39,430
The prince was really smart to search for the princess that way.

9
00:00:40,030 --> 00:00:43,910
What if we get separated in the future?

10
00:00:44,370 --> 00:00:46,570
Should we have a secret code like that too?

11
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:51,540
Let’s use this code then.

12
00:01:16,630 --> 00:01:19,630
Pharinyakorn Khansawa
as Ob-aun.

13
00:01:20,539 --> 00:01:23,500
Koraphat Lamnoi
as Shan

14
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:28,230
Jassada Janmano
as Ozone

15
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:31,650
Sorntast Buangam
as Pie.

16
00:01:33,479 --> 00:01:36,009
Willi Anavil
as Sin.

17
00:01:37,789 --> 00:01:40,050
Poonyavee Ekpankul
as Jingjang

18
00:01:41,650 --> 00:01:44,300
Conan Wu
as Jao Samut

19
00:01:46,190 --> 00:01:48,570
Zale Ruan
as Akin

20
00:01:50,140 --> 00:01:52,370
Chaianun Chaichaowarat
as Intouch

21
00:01:59,650 --> 00:02:04,250
Director
Nathawat Piyanonpong

22
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:24,710
Shan, when will you come back home? Mom misses you.

23
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:27,800
Probably in a while.

24
00:02:29,050 --> 00:02:31,940
What about Ob-aun, are you two together yet?

25
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:34,740
Hey, don’t overlook his feelings.

26
00:02:36,430 --> 00:02:40,370
I’m not, I’m just waiting for things to settle down first.

27
00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:46,800
That’s good. Don’t forget to bring Ob-aun to meet me, I really want to meet him.

28
00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:49,710
Sure, talk to you later then.

29
00:02:51,710 --> 00:02:53,570
Why are you up so early?

30
00:02:55,310 --> 00:02:57,340
Who were you on the phone with?

31
00:03:02,430 --> 00:03:03,850
My mom.

32
00:03:04,970 --> 00:03:06,940
She’s urging me to bring you home again.

33
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,310
She’s worried I’m not making us official.

34
00:03:12,140 --> 00:03:15,170
Your mom told you to bring me home?

35
00:03:22,510 --> 00:03:26,280
Yes, she adores you so much.

36
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:32,450
If you’re okay, let’s go home together.

37
00:03:39,630 --> 00:03:43,600
But if you’re not comfortable, I won’t rush you.

38
00:03:46,630 --> 00:03:51,230
I just … don’t know how to take you to my home.

39
00:03:52,140 --> 00:03:54,340
Both my parents have passed away.

40
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:03,450
I’m sorry, I should have found you sooner.

41
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:08,230
It’s okay, it’s been years.

42
00:04:08,630 --> 00:04:10,030
I’m fine now.

43
00:04:10,830 --> 00:04:12,170
I know.

44
00:04:12,940 --> 00:04:17,200
But from now on, I won’t leave you alone ever again.

45
00:04:24,050 --> 00:04:27,310
Alright, let me cook something for you.

46
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:29,110
Stay here.

47
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,740
This is a premium sea cucumber porridge.

48
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:55,280
You know how to make sea cucumber porridge?

49
00:04:56,510 --> 00:04:58,140
Someone likes it, so I learned.

50
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:01,630
You remember that?

51
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:06,110
Of course, I do. You’re my boyfriend.

52
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:11,600
Here, let me feed you.

53
00:05:24,510 --> 00:05:25,910
It’s delicious.

54
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:33,340
So, can I take a picture and show it off to Ozone and the others?

55
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,370
Sure.

56
00:05:44,450 --> 00:05:46,510
Sea cucumber porridge, so yummy.

57
00:05:47,110 --> 00:05:52,770
No matter how many pictures you take or what filters you use, it’s still just porridge.

58
00:05:52,770 --> 00:05:56,650
I want some too, but I’m still in bed.

59
00:05:56,740 --> 00:05:58,540
How did you make it? Is it hard?

60
00:06:01,540 --> 00:06:03,940
P’Jao Samut …
Just tell him to download a food delivery app.

61
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,650
Hey, it seems like your voice got in there.

62
00:06:09,650 --> 00:06:12,000
And I accidentally sent it. What now?

63
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:15,080
I thought you were typing.

64
00:06:15,910 --> 00:06:18,230
It’s fine, watch me.

65
00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:29,850
May fortune bless you.

66
00:06:29,850 --> 00:06:31,970
Nothing happened, okay?

67
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:35,830
Thank you, Great God Shan, for the red envelope.

68
00:06:38,430 --> 00:06:42,570
But what’s going on between you two?

69
00:06:44,140 --> 00:06:47,510
I came to see Shan and eat porridge.

70
00:06:49,630 --> 00:06:50,740
Really?

71
00:06:50,740 --> 00:06:52,370
Who made that porridge?

72
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:54,280
Shan did.

73
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,450
What do we do now?

74
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:06,630
It’s just Sin and P’Jao Samut, nothing big.

75
00:07:06,630 --> 00:07:08,200
Let them know.

76
00:07:09,570 --> 00:07:13,710
So, you’re saying Ozone has known about us from the start?

77
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:17,480
Ozone overheard me confessing to you.

78
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:18,850
What?

79
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:20,110
Hey.

80
00:07:20,770 --> 00:07:24,630
I thought you’d told him about our past.

81
00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:29,800
So, we don’t have to hide anymore, right?

82
00:07:33,450 --> 00:07:35,280
Should we just tell them?

83
00:07:36,250 --> 00:07:37,710
Okay.

84
00:07:41,370 --> 00:07:44,740
Yeah, Shan and I …

85
00:07:44,740 --> 00:07:47,570
You two must be related.

86
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:54,970
P’Jao Samut, could you just leave this group already?

87
00:07:57,909 --> 00:08:02,230
I think … Shan and Ob-aun are dating.

88
00:08:02,230 --> 00:08:03,540
What?

89
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:07,830
Yes.

90
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:10,710
I’ll treat you all to a meal later.

91
00:08:11,450 --> 00:08:13,570
Oh, right, Ob-aun.

92
00:08:13,570 --> 00:08:15,540
I’m going out this afternoon.

93
00:08:15,540 --> 00:08:19,480
If you finish writing the new chapter, just log in and upload it yourself.

94
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:20,450
Okay.

95
00:08:20,450 --> 00:08:23,940
Are we almost done with this novel?

96
00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:27,420
Yes, just one more scene left.

97
00:08:40,510 --> 00:08:43,970
Ah, I know what to write now.

98
00:08:46,910 --> 00:08:50,650
Babe, can you come to work with me today?

99
00:08:51,370 --> 00:08:54,170
Please?

100
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:58,940
No, I don’t want to bother you at work.

101
00:09:02,050 --> 00:09:04,400
I’ll stay here and cook for you.

102
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:08,370
You’re staying home to finish your novel, right?

103
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:10,370
You figured me out.

104
00:09:12,030 --> 00:09:14,110
I have to update two novels,

105
00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:18,450
‘The Villain’s Strategy Guide’ and the last chapter of ‘Ballad of the Sandstorm’.

106
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:20,200
So …

107
00:09:21,340 --> 00:09:23,830
I’ll cook for you and deliver it at noon.

108
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:27,030
Okay.

109
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:31,030
I’m off to work.

110
00:09:32,710 --> 00:09:34,340
See you at noon.

111
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:55,430
Finally done.

112
00:10:03,650 --> 00:10:06,480
Let’s proofread one more time.

113
00:10:16,170 --> 00:10:17,600
Update.

114
00:10:19,970 --> 00:10:23,830
All done. Time to make food for Shan.

115
00:10:36,910 --> 00:10:40,710
Why did I see the ending of ‘Ballad of the Sandstorm’ in ‘The Villain’s Strategy Guide’?

116
00:10:40,710 --> 00:10:43,940
I didn't expect to get Shen An and Duan Ru Xing’s sweet moments.

117
00:13:22,140 --> 00:13:24,570
I promise to be gentler this time.

118
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:14,510
This is just a fictional world created by a writer who plagiarized.

119
00:14:14,510 --> 00:14:17,570
Aren’t you afraid of having the same ending as me?

120
00:14:19,940 --> 00:14:22,140
If you think this is a fictional world,

121
00:14:23,170 --> 00:14:27,740
how would you explain what you just did?

122
00:14:33,310 --> 00:14:38,030
Li Chuan, though this world is created by a writer,

123
00:14:40,170 --> 00:14:43,600
neither I nor Song Ye …

124
00:14:44,650 --> 00:14:47,910
can control your fate

125
00:14:48,740 --> 00:14:51,570
since the moment you were born.

126
00:14:51,570 --> 00:14:55,740
So even if Song Ye violated copyright and distorted reality,

127
00:14:56,170 --> 00:15:02,230
Duan Ru Xing and Shen An will overcome obstacles and eventually meet anyway.

128
00:15:04,630 --> 00:15:06,050
As for you,

129
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:10,510
You have breath, life, and spirit.

130
00:15:11,910 --> 00:15:14,970
Your destiny is in your hands.

131
00:15:15,910 --> 00:15:18,250
Only you can determine it.

132
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:24,110
You and Shen An started off on the wrong foot,

133
00:15:26,650 --> 00:15:30,050
but that doesn’t mean it’s the end.

134
00:15:34,540 --> 00:15:38,220
I believe one day you’ll find the right person.

135
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:46,140
I can determine my own fate?

136
00:15:47,910 --> 00:15:49,880
I’ll meet my person?

137
00:15:52,230 --> 00:15:54,540
Will that day really come?

138
00:16:01,510 --> 00:16:03,370
The riverbank in the great forest …

139
00:16:04,370 --> 00:16:09,030
is where you and Shen An started your bond.

140
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:13,540
The end is also a beginning.

141
00:16:14,850 --> 00:16:17,540
If you don’t want to stay trapped in sorrow,

142
00:16:18,340 --> 00:16:20,710
just look back.

143
00:16:21,650 --> 00:16:25,970
Maybe there’s still a chance to change things.

144
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:47,650
The riverbank in the great forest?

145
00:16:48,740 --> 00:16:50,880
What’s mysterious about it?

146
00:16:57,910 --> 00:17:01,600
I just saw him lift his sword,

147
00:17:03,140 --> 00:17:07,250
but he wasn’t heading toward Shen An and Duan Ru Xing.

148
00:17:09,630 --> 00:17:12,050
It looked like he didn’t want to live anymore.

149
00:17:13,339 --> 00:17:19,050
If going back can reignite hope in him, then it’s worth it.

150
00:17:21,569 --> 00:17:23,369
And who knows?

151
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:28,109
Maybe he might find his new chapter along the way.

152
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:33,770
His fate has already branched into hundreds, or even thousands of paths

153
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:36,710
from the moment he turned around,

154
00:17:39,110 --> 00:17:40,850
but this time,

155
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,970
I hope he chooses the right one.

156
00:17:50,230 --> 00:17:55,140
I never expected Master Lan Zhen, who seems cold on the outside,

157
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:58,340
to be so warm-hearted,

158
00:18:00,630 --> 00:18:03,030
and so caring for others.

159
00:18:08,910 --> 00:18:11,140
Anyway, is what you said just now true?

160
00:18:12,170 --> 00:18:15,140
This world isn’t controlled by the writer?

161
00:18:16,050 --> 00:18:20,230
Can you still find a way out after transmigrating here?

162
00:18:22,110 --> 00:18:25,940
What I said wasn’t entirely true.

163
00:18:27,140 --> 00:18:30,940
After all, I am still the writer of this story,

164
00:18:32,450 --> 00:18:35,970
so I still have some control. As long as I want to …

165
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:39,880
I can stay here.

166
00:18:42,570 --> 00:18:46,970
It’s not about wanting to stay. You have to stay here.

167
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:19,140
Hello Shan.

168
00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:22,800
I found some news about you and Ob-aun. Want to hear it?

169
00:19:23,910 --> 00:19:29,020
Oh, Ob-aun is the author of The Villain’s Strategy Guide?
What happened? Why’s there so much backlash?

170
00:19:29,050 --> 00:19:33,340
Ob-aun swapped The Villain’s Strategy Guide and Ballad of the Sandstorm while uploading them.

171
00:19:33,340 --> 00:19:36,650
Even though he fixed it, his pen name was already exposed.

172
00:19:37,340 --> 00:19:39,310
The comment section is exploding.

173
00:19:39,310 --> 00:19:43,370
Hey Ob-aun, you’re trending on Twitter.

174
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,370
I fixed it, but looks like I’m too late.

175
00:19:48,830 --> 00:19:52,910
It isn’t that bad in Instagram, but the comment sections are brutal.

176
00:19:52,910 --> 00:19:56,140
They were praising your writing just the other day.

177
00:19:56,400 --> 00:20:00,000
It’s my fault. I rushed to deliver food to Shan.

178
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,480
I didn’t double-check before uploading.

179
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:06,400
Love really does make people blind.

180
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:09,030
And the main culprit isn’t even here.

181
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:10,830
He’s at work.

182
00:20:11,140 --> 00:20:12,850
This isn’t too hard to handle.

183
00:20:13,910 --> 00:20:18,110
The real issue is how you want to deal with it, Ob-aun.

184
00:20:21,050 --> 00:20:24,370
Just let it die down. People will forget soon enough.

185
00:20:24,370 --> 00:20:28,540
This isn’t as bad as the plagiarism scandal last time.

186
00:20:28,540 --> 00:20:32,450
No, I can’t let you keep getting attacked.

187
00:20:32,450 --> 00:20:35,800
The longer we stay silent, the worse it gets.

188
00:20:35,970 --> 00:20:37,800
I’ll take care of this.

189
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:41,480
What are you going to do?

190
00:20:43,630 --> 00:20:48,570
First, we need a scapegoat to take the fall for the five of us.

191
00:20:49,650 --> 00:20:54,170
It has to be someone who could order us to write this BL story.

192
00:20:55,540 --> 00:20:56,910
Money, right?

193
00:20:58,850 --> 00:21:00,340
YS.

194
00:21:02,140 --> 00:21:05,430
Why would YS order us to write this?

195
00:21:05,430 --> 00:21:07,570
It’s one of their projects.

196
00:21:08,850 --> 00:21:10,540
I get it now.

197
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:13,430
This project is called …

198
00:21:13,430 --> 00:21:15,970
‘One story of moments in time’.

199
00:21:15,970 --> 00:21:19,850
There’s been a lot of debate about gender issues online lately.

200
00:21:19,850 --> 00:21:24,540
YS invited 5 writers from each genre to write a BL story for this project.

201
00:21:25,030 --> 00:21:29,310
So, we were commissioned by YS to write this novel?

202
00:21:29,630 --> 00:21:30,680
Yes.

203
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:35,000
YS’s first step was to invite male writers to write a BL story.

204
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,800
Your plan is genius.

205
00:21:39,540 --> 00:21:42,310
But we’ll need YS’s cooperation.

206
00:21:42,310 --> 00:21:47,000
We’ll have to talk to the board. Will they go along with it?

207
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:52,570
I’m on the YS board.

208
00:21:58,310 --> 00:22:00,680
I’m one of the major shareholders.

209
00:22:06,430 --> 00:22:08,480
You’re a YS shareholder?

210
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,680
Yeah, because of you.

211
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:18,370
You bought YS stock hoping one day you’d find me?

212
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:25,340
I’ve never forgotten your dream.

213
00:22:25,340 --> 00:22:28,880
You wanted to be a writer, so I bought YS stock,

214
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:31,970
and invested in literary magazines and websites,

215
00:22:32,110 --> 00:22:34,480
Even though it seemed hopeless,

216
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:38,400
at least I created a stage for you to showcase your talent.

217
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:41,970
I wrote novels for YS under the name ‘Shi Er Ye,’

218
00:22:42,430 --> 00:22:44,940
hoping that one day we’d meet again.

219
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:50,280
But you never told me any of this before.

220
00:22:51,430 --> 00:22:53,110
Are you mad at me?

221
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:57,880
Well, just a little.

222
00:23:01,340 --> 00:23:04,430
What should I do to make it up for you?

223
00:23:18,970 --> 00:23:20,770
Does this help?

224
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:25,140
No, you have to take me to Chiang Mai.

225
00:23:27,170 --> 00:23:28,450
Sure.

226
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:34,770
Let go.

227
00:23:34,970 --> 00:23:36,340
No.

228
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:42,650
Hey!

229
00:23:51,220 --> 00:23:55,910
The gossip that hasn’t leaked yet is that Shan is the major shareholder of YS.

230
00:23:55,940 --> 00:23:58,430
And Ob-aun got in by connections.

231
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:01,140
Thank you, Intouch.

232
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:05,770
If you hadn’t stopped this gossip in time, it would have caused serious damage.

233
00:24:07,740 --> 00:24:10,170
So, you’re not mad at me anymore?

234
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:16,050
If I hadn’t hired someone to follow you and Ob-aun,

235
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:18,510
this mess wouldn’t have happened.

236
00:24:19,370 --> 00:24:23,170
All I can do now is buy up all these gossip articles.

237
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:28,450
As for Ob-aun mixing up his pen names, I can’t do much about that.

238
00:24:29,170 --> 00:24:32,340
Okay, I’ll handle that.

239
00:24:33,050 --> 00:24:34,740
If …

240
00:24:35,850 --> 00:24:37,200
I mean …

241
00:24:38,340 --> 00:24:42,540
If 10 years ago, when you lived in that villa,

242
00:24:42,540 --> 00:24:44,710
I was the one beside you,

243
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:48,430
Everything wouldn’t have been like this, right?

244
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:52,310
We would’ve had a chance to be together, right?

245
00:24:54,510 --> 00:24:55,970
I think …

246
00:24:57,340 --> 00:24:58,630
No.

247
00:24:59,540 --> 00:25:01,110
Sorry.

248
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:04,250
But we can still be friends.

249
00:25:05,310 --> 00:25:09,480
And I hope you and Ob-aun can be friends too.

250
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:38,110
Whoa.

251
00:25:48,940 --> 00:25:50,230
Shan.

252
00:25:52,250 --> 00:25:56,280
I messed up. What should I do?

253
00:25:57,510 --> 00:26:00,370
It’s okay. I’ll take care of it.

254
00:26:05,030 --> 00:26:06,880
Argh!

255
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:10,480
We messed up, what do we do now?

256
00:26:10,910 --> 00:26:13,970
Should we get YS’s management’s help?

257
00:26:18,910 --> 00:26:23,250
But who’s going to approach them?

258
00:26:23,850 --> 00:26:26,140
Who will handle this?

259
00:26:28,030 --> 00:26:31,540
I can’t disclose my position, but I can ask someone.

260
00:26:32,110 --> 00:26:33,970
I know who you’re talking about.

261
00:26:34,370 --> 00:26:37,680
Let me handle it. Just wait for the good news.

262
00:26:44,830 --> 00:26:46,340
P’Pie.

263
00:26:46,340 --> 00:26:48,370
Make sure to send the manuscript on time.

264
00:26:50,250 --> 00:26:52,480
You’re so cold.

265
00:26:52,710 --> 00:26:57,050
We’re together, but I separate work from personal matters.

266
00:26:58,710 --> 00:27:03,480
P’Pie, I’ve got a deal for you. Are you interested?

267
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:07,630
What is it?

268
00:27:17,710 --> 00:27:22,110
YS’s annual project, One Story of Moments in Time, was launched before the schedule.

269
00:27:27,310 --> 00:27:31,340
You’re a woman, how much are you going to read?

270
00:27:31,340 --> 00:27:34,770
Why do you read so much?

271
00:27:34,770 --> 00:27:37,800
Are you sure you can make a living off it?

272
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:41,650
You should just settle down and get married.

273
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:46,230
Hey, a guy in pink? Are you gay?

274
00:27:50,310 --> 00:27:54,510
This position is only for women.

275
00:27:56,140 --> 00:28:00,310
Why do people keep saying women only need to be pretty?

276
00:28:00,770 --> 00:28:04,830
And why do guys get bullied for liking pink?

277
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:10,140
I’m qualified, but you won’t choose me because of my gender?

278
00:28:11,450 --> 00:28:17,970
What are you thinking? Do you understand me? Respect me? Believe in me?

279
00:28:17,970 --> 00:28:21,970
Why do we divide and stereotype men and women?

280
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:30,420
Today, YS brings you a battle of ideas between popular writers about men and women.

281
00:28:30,420 --> 00:28:33,370
Whether man or woman, I am part of you.

282
00:28:33,370 --> 00:28:36,230
YS has invited 5 popular male writers

283
00:28:36,230 --> 00:28:39,630
to co-write a BL novel under the pen name ‘The 5yes of Wonder’.

284
00:28:39,630 --> 00:28:46,250
Initially, we planned to launch this after the final chapter of the novel,

285
00:28:46,250 --> 00:28:50,970
but one writer accidentally revealed his pen name.

286
00:28:50,970 --> 00:28:55,050
That’s right, one of the writers in the project, One Story of Moments in Time,

287
00:28:55,050 --> 00:28:58,970
is none other than the martial arts writer,

288
00:28:58,970 --> 00:29:02,230
Little Prince.

289
00:29:02,230 --> 00:29:05,310
There are still 4 more writers.

290
00:29:05,310 --> 00:29:09,540
If you’ve followed The 5yes of Wonder’s novels, you might have a clue.

291
00:29:09,540 --> 00:29:14,880
We’ll reveal one writer per week from now on,

292
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:17,050
so please stay tuned!

293
00:29:20,250 --> 00:29:25,800
As expected of Pie. Time is tight, but this project is flawless.

294
00:29:25,910 --> 00:29:31,250
Well, I kind of sold our team out to make him take the fall for us.

295
00:29:31,250 --> 00:29:35,480
We might have to cooperate on any upcoming events they will be hosting.

296
00:29:35,770 --> 00:29:37,200
No problem.

297
00:29:37,740 --> 00:29:40,800
But since when was Pie so easy to talk to?

298
00:29:41,540 --> 00:29:42,850
Right?

299
00:29:43,370 --> 00:29:45,830
Oh, we’re revealing one writer a week.

300
00:29:45,830 --> 00:29:48,770
Who’s up for next week?

301
00:29:56,250 --> 00:29:57,630
How about Shan?

302
00:29:58,370 --> 00:30:01,710
No, the next one should be P’Jao Samut.

303
00:30:03,770 --> 00:30:05,570
Why’s that?

304
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:08,970
Because his image is reliable.

305
00:30:08,970 --> 00:30:13,230
Having him as the second reveal will make this project even more interesting.

306
00:30:13,340 --> 00:30:17,970
Once P’Jao Samut shows up, the trolls won’t mess with us anymore.

307
00:30:35,450 --> 00:30:39,050
Hey, come sit here.

308
00:30:43,450 --> 00:30:45,430
Help me stir things up.

309
00:30:45,630 --> 00:30:47,110
Sit down.

310
00:30:48,770 --> 00:30:50,370
What are you stirring?

311
00:30:50,370 --> 00:30:52,450
Check this out.

312
00:30:53,140 --> 00:30:58,600
Let’s bet on who are the 5 writers of The Villain’s Strategy Guide.

313
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:02,450
Haha! I’m guessing God Shan is one of them.

314
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:04,220
I bet Intouch is there too.

315
00:31:04,910 --> 00:31:07,200
Do you think Jao Samut is also one?

316
00:31:07,220 --> 00:31:12,170
I remember a post said the writing style reminded them of Jao Samut.

317
00:31:12,340 --> 00:31:17,940
Nah, Jao Samut’s style is too old-fashioned for BL.

318
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:22,600
Hey, are you even writing?

319
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:25,510
I bet Ozone’s in it for sure.

320
00:31:27,310 --> 00:31:29,340
You know my name—?

321
00:31:30,140 --> 00:31:35,450
Actually, I don’t enjoy Duan Ru Xing and Shen An much.

322
00:31:35,450 --> 00:31:40,050
I like Lian’er, he always appears at the right time.

323
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:42,570
Ozone must be the one who created him.

324
00:31:42,740 --> 00:31:45,370
Oh, Lian’er.

325
00:31:48,450 --> 00:31:51,570
Don’t leave yet. Order something.

326
00:31:51,570 --> 00:31:53,450
Stay here and help me stir things up.

327
00:31:55,220 --> 00:31:57,310
But I’m not paying for you.

328
00:31:57,880 --> 00:31:59,000
Okay.

329
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:04,140
We’re so cool, not just us,

330
00:32:04,140 --> 00:32:06,620
but our readers are joining in too.

331
00:32:06,850 --> 00:32:11,710
Of course, it’s all thanks to me blending in with the online community.

332
00:32:15,220 --> 00:32:17,110
Ozone is quite tough.

333
00:32:17,110 --> 00:32:20,620
You’ve been mentioned many times, but haven't slipped up yet.

334
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:24,450
Come on, don’t you remember?

335
00:32:24,450 --> 00:32:27,310
My writing has been criticized before.

336
00:32:37,770 --> 00:32:38,940
Sure thing.

337
00:32:40,420 --> 00:32:41,600
Bye.

338
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:47,570
Hi, my new secretary.

339
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:50,340
Have you adjusted well?

340
00:32:51,740 --> 00:32:53,280
You’re still laughing?

341
00:32:54,570 --> 00:32:56,450
Everyone misunderstood us,

342
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:59,050
thinking I’m your new assistant.

343
00:32:59,620 --> 00:33:05,170
Yesterday, someone gave me documents to pass on to you.

344
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:09,800
If this keeps up, Mr. President will have to give me a raise.

345
00:33:11,710 --> 00:33:15,170
Sure, you can have everything.

346
00:33:15,170 --> 00:33:17,170
I’m all yours.

347
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:30,420
I hope we meet sooner.

348
00:33:30,910 --> 00:33:35,080
We’ve known each other for 10 years, isn’t that soon enough?

349
00:33:36,940 --> 00:33:39,080
But still, we wasted 10 years.

350
00:33:40,570 --> 00:33:45,280
You know, it breaks my heart that I didn't recognize you from the start.

351
00:33:46,650 --> 00:33:49,310
And I wish to know you earlier.

352
00:33:52,170 --> 00:33:55,740
Just seeing you inspires me.

353
00:33:57,620 --> 00:34:02,280
Oh, why do you have my pic in your inspiration box?

354
00:34:03,450 --> 00:34:05,170
Because I like you.

355
00:34:07,570 --> 00:34:09,820
We shouldn’t talk about this here,

356
00:34:12,850 --> 00:34:14,420
but I like you too.

357
00:34:20,510 --> 00:34:22,280
Where do you want to talk about it?

358
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:24,969
Wherever you want.

359
00:34:45,139 --> 00:34:47,139
P’Jao Samut just sent a message.

360
00:34:52,510 --> 00:34:55,110
Is everyone still awake? I have urgent news.

361
00:34:55,110 --> 00:34:57,800
What is it, P’Jao Samut?

362
00:34:57,800 --> 00:35:01,200
You all know I’m getting married next Saturday, right?

363
00:35:03,420 --> 00:35:07,170
Don’t worry, P’Jao Samut, we’ll definitely attend your wedding.

364
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:14,050
My fiancée just told me who the bridesmaids are.

365
00:35:14,050 --> 00:35:15,310
Who?

366
00:35:17,050 --> 00:35:23,570
Yunfei, Tiao Tiao Kitty, Meng Ting Yu, and Chai Su.

367
00:35:23,570 --> 00:35:28,050
Wow, the 4 queens of romance from YS!

368
00:35:28,650 --> 00:35:31,970
P’Jao Samut, you’re in trouble.

369
00:35:33,820 --> 00:35:38,110
Yunfei is a legend, Tiao Tiao Kitty loves pulling pranks,

370
00:35:38,110 --> 00:35:42,510
Chai Su is the queen of palace dramas, and Meng Meng is the drama queen.

371
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:48,280
P’Jao Samut, I’m starting to worry you won’t even get to see your bride.

372
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:51,540
Man, you’re making me tear up.

373
00:35:51,540 --> 00:35:55,310
Don’t chicken out, we’ll be your groomsmen.

374
00:35:55,310 --> 00:36:00,940
I bet we will be the best looking groomsmen in history

375
00:36:00,940 --> 00:36:04,280
I guarantee no bridesmaid can stop us.

376
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:06,820
I’m counting on you guys.

377
00:36:06,820 --> 00:36:07,940
Okay.

378
00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:23,820
Shan, how do I tie this tie?

379
00:36:23,970 --> 00:36:25,820
Come here, I’ll help.

380
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:33,710
What are you thinking? You’re blushing.

381
00:36:35,710 --> 00:36:40,110
I’m thinking … it feels like we’re getting ready for our own wedding.

382
00:36:42,510 --> 00:36:44,200
There’s one more step left.

383
00:36:45,170 --> 00:36:46,370
What’s that?

384
00:37:02,570 --> 00:37:05,480
Shan, what are you doing?

385
00:37:07,340 --> 00:37:09,620
This is part of the wedding preparations.

386
00:38:08,910 --> 00:38:11,800
Hey, have you seen Meng Meng’s IG?

387
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:15,480
Have a look.

388
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:20,620
Let’s take a picture for our IG too.

389
00:38:21,620 --> 00:38:24,620
Come on, guys, look at the camera.

390
00:38:29,050 --> 00:38:33,510
Can we get a little bit closer?

391
00:38:34,970 --> 00:38:36,820
One, two, three.

392
00:38:43,540 --> 00:38:45,740
Dashing wedding gang

393
00:38:46,250 --> 00:38:51,280
Is it just me, or are Shan and Ob-aun’s outfits different from everyone else’s?

394
00:38:55,170 --> 00:39:02,050
I’ve got a strong feeling that these 5 guys is The 5yes of Wonder.

395
00:39:27,770 --> 00:39:30,250
If you want to see the bride, dance first.

396
00:39:31,910 --> 00:39:36,480
Dance, dance!

397
00:39:36,680 --> 00:39:38,370
Alright.

398
00:39:39,910 --> 00:39:42,220
Let’s go!
Ozone!

399
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:46,250
One, two, three, go!

400
00:40:05,620 --> 00:40:07,110
You passed.

401
00:40:22,540 --> 00:40:25,370
Now shout your love for the bride.

402
00:40:27,250 --> 00:40:28,140
Hurry up.

403
00:40:29,850 --> 00:40:35,570
Go go!

404
00:40:36,140 --> 00:40:37,800
I love you.

405
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:41,340
What? I can’t hear you.

406
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:44,800
Louder!

407
00:40:47,340 --> 00:40:49,650
I love you!

408
00:40:51,650 --> 00:40:53,340
Jao Samut!

409
00:40:54,140 --> 00:40:56,800
Okay, passed. Where’s my envelope?

410
00:42:10,970 --> 00:42:13,620
So beautiful.

411
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:51,220
Ozone.
Ob-aun.

412
00:42:51,220 --> 00:42:52,620
Whoa.

413
00:42:52,620 --> 00:42:54,080
How was that?

414
00:42:54,080 --> 00:42:56,020
So much fun.

415
00:42:56,020 --> 00:42:58,200
Hey, you’re so drunk.

416
00:42:58,200 --> 00:42:59,770
You also drank a lot.

417
00:42:59,770 --> 00:43:03,480
No, I didn’t drink that much.
You totally did.

418
00:43:03,480 --> 00:43:05,510
I know what I saw!

419
00:43:06,200 --> 00:43:07,850
You’ve been pouring me drinks!

420
00:43:07,850 --> 00:43:09,420
Let’s talk tomorrow, Ob-aun.

421
00:43:09,710 --> 00:43:10,650
Let’s go.

422
00:43:12,220 --> 00:43:14,850
Bye.
Good night.

423
00:43:17,480 --> 00:43:21,020
See you tomorrow.
Ozone, come with me.

424
00:43:51,420 --> 00:43:52,800
Demon Lord.

425
00:43:54,280 --> 00:43:55,820
Don’t come any closer.

426
00:44:18,420 --> 00:44:19,940
Good boy.

427
00:44:21,480 --> 00:44:23,850
Don’t sleep just yet.

428
00:44:26,540 --> 00:44:28,370
You should change first.

429
00:44:44,370 --> 00:44:48,450
That’s enough, you’ve had too much.

430
00:44:49,800 --> 00:44:51,420
I’m not that drunk.

431
00:44:53,370 --> 00:44:55,540
I just can’t see your eyes clearly.

432
00:45:00,370 --> 00:45:02,310
If you can’t see me, just hold me.

433
00:45:14,450 --> 00:45:15,940
You smell good.

434
00:45:17,200 --> 00:45:18,910
Did you put on cologne?

435
00:45:21,940 --> 00:45:23,340
No.

436
00:45:24,020 --> 00:45:27,510
I haven’t worn any in a while because you don’t like it.

437
00:45:29,910 --> 00:45:31,650
But I know what it is.

438
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:38,480
What is it?

439
00:45:45,310 --> 00:45:50,420
Phe… ro… mones.

440
00:46:11,110 --> 00:46:14,830
Director
Nathawat Piyanonpong

441
00:46:15,110 --> 00:46:16,880
I’m going to propose to Ob-aun.

442
00:46:16,880 --> 00:46:21,420
There’s half a month left until the press conference for YS’s project.

443
00:46:21,420 --> 00:46:24,620
The 5yes of Wonder will be the highlight.

444
00:46:24,620 --> 00:46:29,250
This novel brought us together, between those lines.

445
00:46:29,770 --> 00:46:31,850
Our story starts here.

446
00:46:32,420 --> 00:46:36,420
And from now on, can I stay by your side for life?
