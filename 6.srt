00:00:11,630 --> 00:00:13,130
Hi, Ozone.

3
00:00:13,130 --> 00:00:15,430
Congratulations! I’ve got a gift for you.

4
00:00:15,430 --> 00:00:17,060
Hey you.

5
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:22,060
Hey you.

6
00:00:25,430 --> 00:00:28,000
I’m the bride’s friend.

7
00:00:28,530 --> 00:00:31,460
What a coincidence, you’re the groom’s friend too?

8
00:00:32,830 --> 00:00:35,630
Uncle Pie is the groom’s uncle.

9
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:44,000
Ah, Uncle.

10
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:47,130
He looks familiar.

11
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:50,300
Oh, did you say you have something for me?

12
00:00:57,960 --> 00:00:59,730
Yeah.

13
00:01:10,230 --> 00:01:11,960
I’ll be heading inside.
Sure.

14
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:13,630
Let me hold onto the gift for you.

15
00:01:13,630 --> 00:01:15,060
Okay, thank you.

16
00:01:23,730 --> 00:01:25,660
You came uninvited.

17
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:31,660
Are you planning to pull any pranks? Your name wasn’t on the guest list.

18
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:41,800
Don’t judge me! I’m just here to congratulate the couple on Min’s behalf.

19
00:01:51,229 --> 00:01:53,400
So you really are up to something.

Director
Nathawat Piyanonpong

30
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:37,660
Come on, let's play a game.

31
00:03:37,660 --> 00:03:40,160
I’m gonna start spinning.

32
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:48,930
Alright, I’ll ask first.

33
00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:52,660
When was your first kiss?

34
00:03:58,100 --> 00:04:00,530
Let’s just say ... It's still safe and sound.

35
00:04:00,530 --> 00:04:03,360
What? Boo!

36
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:05,230
Next round.

37
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,700
Can I ask you a question, P’Pie?

38
00:04:11,930 --> 00:04:16,959
Do you have a crush with someone at this table?

39
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:38,830
Bro, let me cover for you. I’m a heavyweight.

40
00:05:09,930 --> 00:05:14,760
You have low alcohol tolerance, yet you’re trying to show off and drink for others.

41
00:05:21,330 --> 00:05:28,360
I’m the prince on the black horse, and I drink on behalf of the demon lord.

42
00:05:28,830 --> 00:05:33,730
Maybe he'll be kinder and treat me better tomorrow.

43
00:06:21,030 --> 00:06:28,700
The company has decided that from now on, I won’t be your editor anymore. If you encounter any issues, go to Editor Yin.

44
00:06:31,530 --> 00:06:35,430
What? Why did they suddenly change my editor?

45
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:48,730
Hey, can we meet up?

46
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:07,330
Bring it on.

47
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:24,130
Let’s take a picture.

48
00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:35,060
How’s my new hair color? Is it cool?

49
00:07:37,230 --> 00:07:38,200
Let’s go.

50
00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:39,900
Yeah.

51
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:47,100
Ozone: Come see these two handsome guys. @Shi Er Ye

52
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:52,230
Unbelievable! Ozone finally posted a picture with Little Prince.
This CP ship is sailing again!

53
00:07:52,230 --> 00:07:56,030
He dyed his hair gray!
And why tag @Shi Er Ye? Are you claiming ownership?

54
00:07:56,060 --> 00:08:00,130
Why did you tag Shan in our picture?

55
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:04,960
This snack is pretty good.

56
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:17,200
It’s nothing. I just wanted to make our fans happy.

57
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:22,930
Recently, your ship with Shi Er Ye has been stealing the spotlight.

58
00:08:22,930 --> 00:08:28,630
So, I’m creating moments for our fans too. I’m good at fan service, anyway.

59
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:33,100
That’s strange.

60
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:37,200
It’s like you’re trying to get someone’s attention.

61
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:41,100
Want some snacks?

62
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:44,030
You’re changing the subject.

63
00:08:45,830 --> 00:08:47,660
Fine, I’ll tell you.

64
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,200
It’s Pie. He has been acting weird.

65
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:59,200
We were good yesterday, but now he’s all cold and distant to me.

66
00:08:59,330 --> 00:09:02,700
And he said he won’t be my editor anymore.

67
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:06,300
Isn’t he the Deputy Director of YS?

68
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:09,630
Where’s his sense of responsibility?

69
00:09:09,630 --> 00:09:13,630
So what? You don’t like him anyway.

70
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:15,860
Changing editors is not a big deal.

71
00:09:16,330 --> 00:09:21,030
Maybe you’ll get a more considerate one.

72
00:09:26,330 --> 00:09:32,630
That’s true, but I feel a strange emptiness for some reason.

73
00:09:35,860 --> 00:09:38,900
Oh, I haven’t told you about this yet.

74
00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:39,830
What is it?

75
00:09:39,830 --> 00:09:43,030
Remember the night we played a game in Chiang Mai?

76
00:09:44,530 --> 00:09:46,660
I talked to Shan before that.

77
00:09:47,230 --> 00:09:51,300
And I felt like something was off with him.

78
00:09:52,030 --> 00:09:53,260
What do you mean?

79
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:54,660
Well ...

80
00:09:57,300 --> 00:10:00,800
I need to talk to you about Ob-aun.

81
00:10:01,730 --> 00:10:04,500
The Little Prince who copied your novel.

82
00:10:04,930 --> 00:10:08,660
Actually, he didn’t copy you, he told me that story a long time ago.

83
00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:12,330
I know.

84
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:16,730
Can you introduce me to Ob-aun?

85
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:20,130
I want to get to know him.

86
00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:23,530
Wait, I'm telling you he didn’t copy anything.

87
00:10:24,860 --> 00:10:29,330
I just want to be friends with him. I never said he copied my novel.

88
00:10:30,230 --> 00:10:32,960
Wouldn’t it be awkward?

89
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:35,630
Ob-aun cares a lot about this matter.

90
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:38,500
I don’t want to lose a friend like him.

91
00:10:39,260 --> 00:10:41,730
I really want to be friends with Ob-aun.

92
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:47,360
Shan said he really wants to be your friend. I got goosebumps hearing that.

93
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:51,860
So I made up a game for you guys to avoid any conflicts.

94
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:53,530
Hm.

95
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:59,030
After getting to know him, Shan seems like a good guy, right?

96
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:05,330
What are you thinking about?

97
00:11:05,730 --> 00:11:07,130
Hey, Ozone.

98
00:11:07,130 --> 00:11:10,100
How will you write the emotional scene between Shen An and Duan Ru Xing?

99
00:11:10,130 --> 00:11:12,900
Huh? What do you mean?

100
00:11:13,930 --> 00:11:18,860
Never mind, I feel like I couldn’t write it well.

101
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:23,500
Don’t overthink it. It’s just two people in love.

102
00:11:24,030 --> 00:11:26,330
Nothing complicated.

103
00:11:26,630 --> 00:11:30,500
Two people in love just do what lovers do.

104
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:35,600
Then, tell me ...

105
00:11:36,330 --> 00:11:41,900
If one person kisses the other without saying anything,

106
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:44,330
what does it mean?

107
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:52,160
It’s an idea I came up with.

108
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:56,730
You don’t understand the meaning of your own idea?

109
00:11:57,030 --> 00:11:59,230
Just what do you want it to be?

110
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,460
I want to ...

111
00:12:04,460 --> 00:12:08,330
Hey, I just thought of something. Do you know Intouch?

112
00:12:08,330 --> 00:12:08,900
Yeah.

113
00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:11,500
He wrote 'Beyond the Peak of Immortal Sanctuary'.

114
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:15,430
I’ve heard of him. He’s a writer for YS too.

115
00:12:15,430 --> 00:12:18,100
He’s been very popular these past two years.

116
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:23,330
I just wanted to tell you that he once confessed his love to Shi Er Ye.

117
00:12:23,330 --> 00:12:24,500
What?

118
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:29,600
I’ve never told anyone, and keeping this secret is killing me.

119
00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:31,300
How do you know?

120
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:36,960
I went to the company to talk to Pie before the YS annual meeting in Chiang Mai.

121
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:40,800
And Pie’s new assistant gave me the wrong directions to the meeting room.

122
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:44,400
I ended up in their place by accident.

123
00:12:55,060 --> 00:12:58,830
Shi Er Ye, I’ve admired you for a long time.

124
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:03,500
When I heard you were attending the annual meeting, I was so excited.

125
00:13:04,460 --> 00:13:05,630
Hm.

126
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:11,600
And by admiring you, I don’t just mean as a fan.

127
00:13:12,730 --> 00:13:16,560
But ... I like you.

128
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:20,960
I really like you, and I have always been.

129
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:25,560
I mean it. Just so you know.

130
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:44,900
I’m sorry, but I can only accept your admiration in a professional sense.

131
00:13:46,330 --> 00:13:48,660
Anything beyond that wouldn’t be appropriate.

132
00:13:52,630 --> 00:13:54,260
Sorry.

133
00:13:57,560 --> 00:14:01,030
Well, I was so tense when that happened.

134
00:14:02,430 --> 00:14:06,500
I also heard that Intouch is from a wealthy family.

135
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:09,600
And he’s close with some of the top YS executives.

136
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:13,800
If they really end up together, they’d make a good couple.

137
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:31,760
Why don’t you stay instead of driving all night?

138
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:34,360
Do you really have to rush back?

139
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:36,000
I want to surprise him.

140
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:38,260
Oh.

141
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:43,860
You’re willing to drive back all night after a 20-hour meeting …

142
00:14:44,630 --> 00:14:48,900
just to surprise him? Is this surprise that important?

143
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:51,960
Yeah, he is important.

144
00:15:12,460 --> 00:15:16,030
Ob-aun, why is your new place so fancy?

145
00:15:16,030 --> 00:15:21,560
I’m sharing the rent with a kind person, or I wouldn’t be able to afford a room this big.

146
00:15:24,060 --> 00:15:28,860
You’ve kept it well hidden. So they’re rich and kind too?

147
00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:31,600
Introduce me to them sometime.

148
00:15:36,930 --> 00:15:38,030
What’s wrong?

149
00:15:39,130 --> 00:15:40,300
Stomachache.

150
00:15:41,460 --> 00:15:43,460
Where’s the bathroom?

151
00:15:43,730 --> 00:15:46,260
Go straight and turn left.

152
00:15:46,260 --> 00:15:48,630
Straight and then left.

153
00:15:50,060 --> 00:15:50,860
What?

154
00:15:50,860 --> 00:15:53,730
Here, right this way.

155
00:15:53,730 --> 00:15:55,730
Follow me, okay?

156
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:26,000
They read about the passionate love story of mine.

157
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:30,030
Learning the bitter secret I've kept confined.

158
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:33,400
Just like the kiss that we once shared.

159
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:38,300
Though they'll never be destined to part like us.

160
00:16:38,930 --> 00:16:42,830
Intouch posted another poem. Who took it?
Don’t tell me Intouch has a partner.

161
00:16:42,830 --> 00:16:44,070
A partner?

162
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:49,100
Didn’t he just confess and get rejected?

163
00:16:53,330 --> 00:16:55,800
The great god of my heart.

164
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:58,560
It can’t be Shan, right?

165
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:02,360
Shan’s calling. Speak of the devil.

166
00:17:07,460 --> 00:17:08,560
Hello?

167
00:17:08,730 --> 00:17:09,829
What are you doing?

168
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:11,800
Reading some poems.

169
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Poem? You like reading poems?

170
00:17:18,030 --> 00:17:22,829
No … I was just browsing.

171
00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:28,900
How was the past few days with Ozone?

172
00:17:31,530 --> 00:17:33,030
Pretty good.

173
00:17:33,330 --> 00:17:38,000
Ozone ate so much that he ended up with a stomachache.

174
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,430
And he still made me cook another meal for him.

175
00:17:41,830 --> 00:17:45,600
Why don’t you just go out to eat? Cooking is tiring.

176
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:53,660
Hey, then why do you always cook for me when you come home?

177
00:17:54,430 --> 00:17:58,000
Because I want to be different from everyone else.

178
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:16,400
Are you sleepy?

179
00:18:16,660 --> 00:18:17,800
Hm.

180
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:21,130
A bit. Haven’t been getting much sleep lately.

181
00:18:21,770 --> 00:18:24,570
Why? Can’t write again?

182
00:18:24,930 --> 00:18:26,570
It’s all because of your kiss.

183
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:31,330
Not really, just having trouble sleeping lately.

184
00:18:32,930 --> 00:18:37,100
But you’re sleepy now. Maybe you should go to bed?

185
00:18:39,430 --> 00:18:42,300
Okay, I’ll go to bed.

186
00:18:44,270 --> 00:18:47,730
I’ll stay with you until you fall asleep.

187
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:00,900
You fell asleep this quickly?

188
00:19:04,470 --> 00:19:08,660
At that place, heaven is pure and humble.

189
00:19:09,630 --> 00:19:12,030
The great river deep and wide,

190
00:19:13,070 --> 00:19:17,170
just like the heart you’ve given to me.

191
00:19:26,330 --> 00:19:32,060
Do you know that your actions made me overthink?

192
00:19:32,060 --> 00:19:33,930
Do you know?

193
00:19:33,930 --> 00:19:36,030
Why are you sleeping on the couch?

194
00:19:39,060 --> 00:19:49,930
I’m sorry for losing control, but it's all out of love for you.

195
00:19:51,430 --> 00:19:59,760
As time passes and changes come, you’re the only one who cares for me.

196
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:04,330
It feels like a dream.

197
00:20:04,330 --> 00:20:10,430
To meet you and stand by your side.

198
00:20:10,430 --> 00:20:17,060
Whatever comes, it's you I'll hold,

199
00:20:36,230 --> 00:20:37,500
What are you doing?

200
00:20:54,860 --> 00:20:56,360
Do you want some water?

201
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:59,630
I wanna take bitter medicine instead.

202
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:03,000
How about we play a game?

203
00:21:04,300 --> 00:21:06,600
Play a game?

204
00:21:07,530 --> 00:21:08,830
Right now?

205
00:21:10,260 --> 00:21:13,700
Ask me five questions, and I’ll answer them all.

206
00:21:16,060 --> 00:21:23,960
Oh, I see. God Ye was caught kissing someone and doesn’t know how to explain.

207
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,430
Alright.

208
00:21:28,900 --> 00:21:30,130
Then let’s start.

209
00:21:30,460 --> 00:21:35,060
You’re Ob-aun’s closest friend, so I won’t hide anything from you.

210
00:21:37,460 --> 00:21:41,760
First question: What’s the relationship between you and Ob-aun?

211
00:21:42,860 --> 00:21:46,200
I’m pursuing Ob-aun. He probably knows by now.

212
00:21:47,530 --> 00:21:49,230
But we’re not officially together.

213
00:21:50,860 --> 00:21:55,400
Even though we’re close, I still need to call you out.

214
00:21:55,800 --> 00:22:00,800
Ob-aun hasn’t accepted you, but you went and stole his kiss.

215
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:03,930
This is not right.

216
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:07,300
Okay, I’ll be more careful next time.

217
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:09,800
There will be a next time?

218
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:14,760
Second question: Is this house yours?

219
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:18,800
Yes, Ob-aun and I are roommates.

220
00:22:19,100 --> 00:22:23,100
Just roommates but your actions were way more than that.

221
00:22:23,730 --> 00:22:24,900
Shan.

222
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:28,030
Let me confirm with this third question.

223
00:22:29,260 --> 00:22:32,330
You … really like Ob-aun, don’t you?

224
00:22:38,460 --> 00:22:40,060
I really like Ob-aun.

225
00:22:44,300 --> 00:22:48,130
Since you’re serious, I don’t know what else to say.

226
00:22:48,660 --> 00:22:53,460
Whether Ob-aun likes you or not is up to him.

227
00:22:53,460 --> 00:22:55,460
I’ll let him decide for himself.

228
00:22:56,900 --> 00:23:01,760
Don’t worry, this time I’m planning to confess my love to him.

229
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:06,560
But when did you two start liking each other?

230
00:23:07,300 --> 00:23:11,930
It’s only been a few months since you met.

231
00:23:12,260 --> 00:23:16,300
Don’t tell me it’s ‘love at first sight’.

232
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:20,260
Besides, you’re reasonable.

233
00:23:20,660 --> 00:23:25,100
I’m not saying that reasonable people can’t experience love at first sight.

234
00:23:25,660 --> 00:23:31,560
But someone like you wouldn’t invest both time and feelings without being sure from the start.

235
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:38,460
Oh, and you writing BL novels with us must be because of Ob-aun, right?

236
00:23:40,130 --> 00:23:43,430
So, fourth question: Why do you like Ob-aun?

237
00:23:48,230 --> 00:23:50,200
Do you remember that Instagram post?

238
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:54,030
The one that talked about my and Ob-aun’s novel,

239
00:23:55,030 --> 00:23:57,200
saying there’s a part that’s similar.

240
00:23:58,930 --> 00:24:00,560
A long time ago,

241
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:06,430
There was a lonely fox who kept receiving letters sent to the wrong address,

242
00:24:08,830 --> 00:24:11,830
and with them, there were always small gifts.

243
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:15,760
But the fox felt troubled,

244
00:24:16,860 --> 00:24:20,760
so it returned all the letters to the postman,

245
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:27,000
and told them not to send those letters again.

246
00:24:38,870 --> 00:24:40,070
Is this the place?

247
00:24:45,430 --> 00:24:49,530
Excuse me, are these the letters you sent?

248
00:24:51,970 --> 00:24:54,300
Are you the little squirrel’s friend?

249
00:24:54,300 --> 00:24:56,200
Hm? You are ...

250
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:58,270
The sender is a little hedgehog.

251
00:24:58,430 --> 00:25:01,870
His letters were sent to a little squirrel named Little Squirrel.

252
00:25:02,570 --> 00:25:06,870
The little hedgehog had spikes all over, so the little squirrel was his only friend.

253
00:25:07,070 --> 00:25:09,930
The little hedgehog was thrilled when he saw the little fox,

254
00:25:09,930 --> 00:25:13,230
thinking that the little squirrel had asked the little fox to visit him.

255
00:25:13,530 --> 00:25:17,070
The little fox didn’t tell him the truth.

256
00:25:17,060 --> 00:25:23,030
He continued to receive the little hedgehog’s letters, sometimes replying and sending seeds in return.

257
00:25:23,270 --> 00:25:27,730
He told the little hedgehog that once the seeds grew into a big tree,

258
00:25:27,730 --> 00:25:30,800
the little squirrel will come back to him.

259
00:25:30,900 --> 00:25:35,400
Then winter came, and the seeds couldn’t grow.

260
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:39,930
So the little hedgehog realized  he had lost contact with the little squirrel a long time ago.

261
00:25:39,930 --> 00:25:43,770
He was so sad that he fell ill and couldn’t recover.

262
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:48,170
When the little fox found out, he dragged a big tree from far away,

263
00:25:48,230 --> 00:25:50,600
and planted it outside the little hedgehog’s cottage.

264
00:25:53,230 --> 00:25:57,900
The next morning, the little hedgehog woke up, opened his window,

265
00:25:57,900 --> 00:26:01,970
and saw a big tree where the seeds had been buried, with a muddy little fox beside it.

266
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:06,300
The little fox smiled and said , "Look, spring has come."

267
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:10,540
This is from your novel, 'Deception'.

268
00:26:11,340 --> 00:26:13,870
It’s similar to Ob-aun’s ‘Fiery Attire’.

269
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:16,100
Yes.

270
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:21,140
How does this relate to your feelings for Ob-aun?

271
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:25,940
Because Ob-aun and I created this story together.

272
00:27:02,900 --> 00:27:04,140
Shan.

273
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:15,540
Did the doctor come too?
Yes.

274
00:27:16,770 --> 00:27:19,800
Doctor, when will I be able to see again?

275
00:27:20,470 --> 00:27:22,240
You’re quite impatient.

276
00:27:22,970 --> 00:27:27,170
After leaving the hospital, be careful not to get an infection.

277
00:27:27,370 --> 00:27:30,770
I’ll schedule weekly check-ups.

278
00:27:32,940 --> 00:27:34,140
Doctor.

279
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:40,670
Can I still be a police officer like this?

280
00:27:46,140 --> 00:27:50,500
You’re very brave for fighting the thief,

281
00:27:50,740 --> 00:27:54,470
But I need to tell you that it’s too dangerous.

282
00:27:55,770 --> 00:27:59,270
Luckily, you came in time.

283
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:04,200
This injury will definitely affect your eyes.

284
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:08,140
But you’ll be able to see again with proper treatment.

285
00:28:10,300 --> 00:28:12,370
Thank you very much.

286
00:28:13,570 --> 00:28:16,100
I met Ob-aun when I was sixteen.

287
00:28:16,300 --> 00:28:19,400
At that time, my eyes were injured in an accident,

288
00:28:19,630 --> 00:28:23,230
and I had to keep them covered with gauze, unable to see anything.

289
00:28:24,030 --> 00:28:27,270
So, I was … blind.

290
00:28:28,030 --> 00:28:34,030
My mother wanted me to rest fully, so she took me to stay at a vacation home for a while.

291
00:29:13,370 --> 00:29:19,700
Every day, if I didn’t go outside to feel the breeze or listen to the leaves,

292
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:23,270
I could only wear earphones and rest in my room.

293
00:29:23,730 --> 00:29:31,300
While being blind, I was immersed in the pain of not being able to follow my dream of being a police officer.

294
00:29:31,830 --> 00:29:34,600
As if falling in a dark cloud.

295
00:29:35,170 --> 00:29:36,330
Until one day …

296
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:38,040
Who’s there?

297
00:29:40,300 --> 00:29:43,240
Mom!

298
00:29:45,570 --> 00:29:47,700
Mom!
Brother, what’s wrong?

299
00:29:49,170 --> 00:29:50,570
What do you want?

300
00:29:50,570 --> 00:29:53,800
I want to play on the swing. Can I join you?

301
00:29:54,300 --> 00:29:55,340
Hmph.

302
00:29:57,940 --> 00:30:00,970
Hi there, where are you from?

303
00:30:01,740 --> 00:30:03,600
My name is Ob-aun.
Okay.

304
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:07,540
I ran after my cat, Shan Yao.

305
00:30:07,540 --> 00:30:09,940
Oh, and where’s your home?

306
00:30:10,300 --> 00:30:12,140
It’s over there.

307
00:30:12,900 --> 00:30:16,440
It’s getting late. How about I take you home?

308
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:21,300
Um, can I come back to play with him tomorrow?

309
00:30:21,300 --> 00:30:23,040
Oh, sure. You’re welcome.

310
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:25,040
No, I don’t want to play with kids.

311
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:27,040
Shan, let him come.

312
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:31,670
Shall I bake some bread for you tomorrow?

313
00:30:31,670 --> 00:30:33,670
Yes, thank you.

314
00:30:33,670 --> 00:30:35,400
Okay, I’ll take you home.

315
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:39,600
Stay here, Shan. I’ll walk him home.

316
00:30:40,700 --> 00:30:41,940
This way?

317
00:30:42,140 --> 00:30:43,240
Yes.

318
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:46,140
Look, they’re butterflies.

319
00:30:46,140 --> 00:30:48,340
And over there are trees.

320
00:30:48,970 --> 00:30:50,970
Let’s play tag.

321
00:30:51,140 --> 00:30:56,840
I’ll run around you, and when you say stop, you have to find me.

322
00:30:57,240 --> 00:30:58,540
Okay, start.

323
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:13,200
Got you!

324
00:32:09,500 --> 00:32:12,240
Why is there nothing in your room?

325
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:25,600
Here are your earphones.

326
00:32:32,170 --> 00:32:36,000
I can’t see, so mom is afraid I’ll bump into things.

327
00:32:36,670 --> 00:32:39,840
Can I ask what happened?

328
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:43,940
I was attacked by thieves.

329
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:48,570
You’re amazing! Are you a martial artist?

330
00:32:48,970 --> 00:32:50,540
So brave.

331
00:32:52,900 --> 00:32:57,440
When can you take off the gauze?

332
00:32:57,970 --> 00:32:59,440
In two months.

333
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:01,640
Then, I’ll be blind with you.

334
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:06,840
I’m keeping my eyes shut, now I can’t see anything.

335
00:33:27,270 --> 00:33:31,170
I’ll explain the whole case in detail.

336
00:33:31,170 --> 00:33:38,700
Mr. Ratchett set his watch an hour back in Tsaribrod, Serbia.

337
00:33:39,130 --> 00:33:44,030
Then he forgot his watch is still set to Eastern European Time,

338
00:33:44,030 --> 00:33:47,430
which is an hour faster than Central European Time.

339
00:33:47,530 --> 00:33:53,570
So, Mr. Ratchett was murdered at 12:15, not 1:15.

340
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:56,240
What are we listening to?

341
00:33:56,700 --> 00:34:00,300
‘Murder on the Orient Express’ by Agatha Christie.

342
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:04,670
Never mind. You probably don’t understand.

343
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:08,270
I know, it’s a detective novel, right?

344
00:34:08,570 --> 00:34:09,969
You know about it?

345
00:34:09,969 --> 00:34:12,770
Yes, I like reading.

346
00:34:12,770 --> 00:34:17,870
My favorite author is Jin Yong, and my favorite character is Linghu Chong.

347
00:34:18,370 --> 00:34:19,870
I didn’t ask.

348
00:34:19,870 --> 00:34:21,540
But I wanted to tell you.

349
00:34:21,540 --> 00:34:25,170
Do you know that Linghu Chong is very skilled?

350
00:34:25,940 --> 00:34:30,370
His special skill is the Nine Swords Of Dugu.

351
00:34:30,739 --> 00:34:32,840
And he has a famous line,

352
00:34:33,070 --> 00:34:36,600
"With a dog's tail added to a sable, and a wild goose stretching its claws in the sand."

353
00:34:38,639 --> 00:34:40,199
Do you like it?

354
00:34:41,770 --> 00:34:42,900
Yes.

355
00:34:43,199 --> 00:34:46,570
Kids, come eat some snacks.

356
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:49,270
Let’s go have snacks. I’ll help you.

357
00:34:54,469 --> 00:34:57,030
At that time, I met Ob-aun.

358
00:34:57,200 --> 00:35:02,230
He was like a little sun, brightening my dark summer vacation.

359
00:35:02,700 --> 00:35:04,600
He liked to talk non-stop,

360
00:35:04,930 --> 00:35:10,700
so I learned his favorite foods, games, and cartoons.

361
00:35:15,330 --> 00:35:20,700
I even knew that his cat, Shan Yao, fought with the neighbor’s dog.

362
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:29,230
With him around, I started to feel that my vacation wasn’t so bad after all.

363
00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:34,470
We listened to Agatha and Linghu Chong’s stories together,

364
00:35:34,900 --> 00:35:38,970
And also The Eight Immortals and Ultraman.

365
00:35:40,340 --> 00:35:45,270
Follow me! Catch me if you can.

366
00:35:46,700 --> 00:35:49,500
Over here. Right here.

367
00:35:49,900 --> 00:35:51,270
Wait for me.

368
00:35:54,300 --> 00:35:56,840
Ha ha, you caught me!

369
00:35:56,840 --> 00:35:58,500
I’m here.

370
00:35:58,640 --> 00:35:59,440
Okay.

371
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:04,100
I’m tired. Can you take me to rest?

372
00:36:04,100 --> 00:36:05,240
Okay.

373
00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:22,200
Move over a bit and sit down.

374
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:23,140
Where?

375
00:36:23,140 --> 00:36:24,470
Right here.

376
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,340
Let’s not play Cops and Robbers again next time.

377
00:36:36,900 --> 00:36:41,000
Why not? Isn’t it your dream to be a cop?

378
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:44,070
I can’t be one anymore.

379
00:36:45,140 --> 00:36:47,300
But you’ll get better, right?

380
00:36:48,770 --> 00:36:50,670
Even if I recover, I still can’t be one.

381
00:36:51,700 --> 00:36:53,470
And you?

382
00:36:54,170 --> 00:36:55,640
What do you want to be in the future?

383
00:36:56,500 --> 00:36:58,200
I want to be a writer.

384
00:36:58,870 --> 00:37:01,740
A writer? Do you know what that is?

385
00:37:01,740 --> 00:37:07,340
Of course. Teacher Liu said I’m the best in my class at writing stories from pictures.

386
00:37:07,340 --> 00:37:11,540
And said that I could definitely be a writer when I grow up.

387
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:16,240
Really? Show me.

388
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:19,470
Once upon a time, in a big forest,

389
00:37:19,470 --> 00:37:22,940
There was a little hedgehog with a little squirrel friend.

390
00:37:23,340 --> 00:37:27,800
One day the squirrel had to move, so the little hedgehog was very sad.

391
00:37:27,940 --> 00:37:29,540
Then …

392
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:31,700
Why don’t they write a letter?

393
00:37:32,340 --> 00:37:36,200
Yes, the little hedgehog wrote a letter to the squirrel,

394
00:37:36,340 --> 00:37:39,270
and sent some delicious food too.

395
00:37:40,470 --> 00:37:43,900
But the little hedgehog wrote the address wrong.

396
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:46,670
What will happen now?

397
00:37:46,670 --> 00:37:49,700
The letter ended up at a little fox’s house.

398
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:52,770
What did the little fox do next?

399
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:57,270
It took the letter and went to find the little hedgehog.

400
00:37:57,870 --> 00:38:03,940
But the little hedgehog misunderstood, thinking the squirrel asked the fox to bring the letter.

401
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:07,870
So, the little hedgehog never found the little squirrel again?

402
00:38:09,940 --> 00:38:14,100
Think of what the fox says in the end by yourself.

403
00:38:18,470 --> 00:38:20,040
I got it!

404
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:23,370
I’ll write about how you helped the police catch the thief.

405
00:38:23,370 --> 00:38:27,340
And send the short story to a magazine.

406
00:38:27,340 --> 00:38:31,200
Teacher Liu said they have a section for young writers.

407
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:34,800
If it’s good, it’ll get published.

408
00:38:36,540 --> 00:38:40,770
Good. If it gets published, you’ll be a young writer.

409
00:38:40,770 --> 00:38:43,200
And everyone will know about your bravery.

410
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:46,200
I’ll do my best to write it well,

411
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:50,570
so they know you’re a brave little cop.

412
00:38:55,100 --> 00:38:58,670
After Ob-aun sent in his manuscript,

413
00:38:58,900 --> 00:39:02,530
I bought the magazine every week as soon as it hit the shelves …

414
00:39:02,830 --> 00:39:06,300
to see if his story was published.

415
00:39:06,630 --> 00:39:08,630
‘The Brave Little Cop.’

416
00:39:09,500 --> 00:39:15,330
Unfortunately, that short story never got published.

417
00:39:30,370 --> 00:39:31,900
I don’t want to eat.

418
00:39:33,700 --> 00:39:34,970
What’s wrong?

419
00:39:35,340 --> 00:39:36,600
I’m sorry.

420
00:39:37,470 --> 00:39:39,000
About what?

421
00:39:39,570 --> 00:39:44,670
It must be because I wrote badly, so it didn’t get published.

422
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:47,800
Now no one will know about you.

423
00:39:49,970 --> 00:39:54,770
It’s alright. Not getting published doesn’t mean it was bad.

424
00:39:56,100 --> 00:39:58,170
There could be other reasons.

425
00:40:00,840 --> 00:40:07,040
I misspoke earlier. You don’t need to get published to be a young writer.

426
00:40:07,870 --> 00:40:11,970
Whether it’s published or not, you’re still a young writer.

427
00:40:14,070 --> 00:40:19,400
But no one will know about how you helped others.

428
00:40:22,170 --> 00:40:25,340
I didn’t do it because I wanted to be famous.

429
00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:28,540
Like when you wrote your short story.

430
00:40:29,870 --> 00:40:32,400
At least you get to practice the thinking process.

431
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,500
That means you made progress.

432
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:39,770
And being a writer means you have to keep writing, right?

433
00:40:41,470 --> 00:40:43,900
Yes, I believe you.

434
00:40:44,770 --> 00:40:46,940
No more crying, let’s eat some snacks.

435
00:40:59,670 --> 00:41:01,140
Should I talk to them for you?

436
00:41:01,570 --> 00:41:06,100
I’ll handle it. Just find the number and dial it for me, please.

437
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:17,940
Here it is.

438
00:41:28,870 --> 00:41:30,000
Hello?

439
00:41:30,740 --> 00:41:34,440
Hello, this is the Children’s magazine editorial office. Where are you calling from?

440
00:41:34,870 --> 00:41:36,930
I’d like to ask something.

441
00:41:38,100 --> 00:41:43,070
There was a manuscript sent in called ‘The Brave Little Cop.’

442
00:41:43,970 --> 00:41:48,540
Can you tell me why it wasn’t chosen?

443
00:41:49,300 --> 00:41:51,400
Are you Ob-aun?

444
00:41:51,970 --> 00:41:55,770
Oh, no. I’m his older brother.

445
00:41:56,700 --> 00:42:01,900
He was disappointed for not getting published, so I wanted to know why.

446
00:42:02,630 --> 00:42:05,530
Actually, the story flows very well.

447
00:42:05,530 --> 00:42:07,130
It has unique vocabulary,

448
00:42:07,130 --> 00:42:12,200
and it uses the style of martial arts novels to write about justice in the modern world.

449
00:42:12,370 --> 00:42:14,300
It's really an amazing work.

450
00:42:14,900 --> 00:42:18,270
But the main character is still young.

451
00:42:18,500 --> 00:42:23,130
We worried that publishing it might lead other kids to imitate the behavior.

452
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:27,270
So in the end, our editorial team decided not to publish it.

453
00:42:30,270 --> 00:42:34,000
Oh, I see. Thank you.

454
00:42:35,170 --> 00:42:38,600
Please tell your little brother not to give up.

455
00:42:39,170 --> 00:42:41,900
Ob-aun is very talented.

456
00:42:45,300 --> 00:42:47,470
Thank you, thank you very much.

457
00:43:01,840 --> 00:43:04,000
Mom, can you help me with something?

458
00:43:04,540 --> 00:43:07,500
Sure. I can help with everything.

459
00:43:08,600 --> 00:43:09,670
Okay.

460
00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:16,540
Stand here.

461
00:43:21,500 --> 00:43:24,440
Congratulations to Ob-aun,

462
00:43:24,440 --> 00:43:27,970
The writer of the excellent work called ‘The Brave Little Cop’.

463
00:43:27,970 --> 00:43:32,500
He’s the winner of this summer short story competition.

464
00:43:32,670 --> 00:43:36,370
So we'd like to give this certificate as an award.

465
00:43:39,900 --> 00:43:41,700
I won?

466
00:43:41,800 --> 00:43:43,300
Yes.

467
00:43:47,470 --> 00:43:50,940
Did I win because I was the only one who entered?

468
00:43:52,270 --> 00:43:56,740
No matter how many contestants there were, you’re number one in my heart.

469
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,370
Yay!

470
00:44:21,170 --> 00:44:25,400
Shan, now that you have Ob-aun, you’re not bored anymore, right?

471
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:27,440
Nope.

472
00:44:29,300 --> 00:44:30,300
Mom?

473
00:44:30,300 --> 00:44:31,240
Yes?

474
00:44:31,240 --> 00:44:34,770
So … what does Ob-aun look like?

475
00:44:34,870 --> 00:44:38,900
Ob-aun? He looks nice, bright, and cheerful.

476
00:44:38,900 --> 00:44:42,240
Especially his eyes, it’s like a little deer’s.

477
00:44:43,470 --> 00:44:45,500
Like a little deer?

478
00:44:45,500 --> 00:44:46,500
Yes.

479
00:44:48,940 --> 00:44:51,270
Open wide.

480
00:44:56,840 --> 00:44:58,900
You'll be able to see tomorrow?

481
00:44:58,900 --> 00:45:01,370
Yeah, the doctor’s going to open my eyes tomorrow.

482
00:45:01,840 --> 00:45:04,200
I’ll bring back some chocolate cake for you.

483
00:45:04,200 --> 00:45:06,700
Really? I’ll be waiting.

484
00:45:06,700 --> 00:45:07,800
Sure.

485
00:45:07,800 --> 00:45:09,870
Pinky promise?

486
00:45:17,270 --> 00:45:19,200
I was too naive back then.

487
00:45:19,470 --> 00:45:24,430
I didn’t know that there are many things in the world that don’t go the way you wish.

488
00:45:25,470 --> 00:45:29,270
While I was enjoying the happy summer vacation,

489
00:45:29,930 --> 00:45:34,370
I couldn’t see, so I had to rest quietly.

490
00:45:35,470 --> 00:45:38,200
Finally, when I was going to be able to see …

491
00:45:38,500 --> 00:45:41,170
To see “Ob-aun’s  little deer’s eyes.

492
00:45:41,870 --> 00:45:43,070
But …

493
00:45:45,340 --> 00:45:47,740
Ob-aun

494
00:45:55,170 --> 00:45:56,440
Ob-aun

495
00:45:59,870 --> 00:46:13,470
Ob-aun

496
00:46:14,830 --> 00:46:18,340
Since that day, I never saw Ob-aun again.

497
00:46:22,900 --> 00:46:26,370
Why? Ob-aun isn’t someone who’d break a promise.

498
00:46:29,640 --> 00:46:34,000
I asked people, but no one knew his family.

499
00:46:35,200 --> 00:46:39,970
Then how do you know that Ob-aun is that boy?

500
00:46:42,170 --> 00:46:46,140
You’ve never seen what he looks like, have you?

501
00:46:50,840 --> 00:46:52,140
By his scent.

502
00:46:54,200 --> 00:46:56,200
Because I remember Ob-aun’s scent.

503
00:46:58,770 --> 00:47:01,000
Over the past ten years,

504
00:47:02,740 --> 00:47:05,470
I kept thinking about that summer.

505
00:47:06,700 --> 00:47:13,670
So when I became a writer, I put the memories from that summer into my work.

506
00:47:14,040 --> 00:47:15,700
Oh, I see.

507
00:47:15,700 --> 00:47:19,940
That’s why the main character in your novel loves chocolate cake like Ob-aun.

508
00:47:21,370 --> 00:47:25,240
Both the little hedgehog and the little fox in ‘Deception,’

509
00:47:25,800 --> 00:47:27,970
The cat in ‘The Spy,’

510
00:47:28,400 --> 00:47:30,700
And even Lin Song Yue in ‘A Blind Heart,’

511
00:47:32,200 --> 00:47:35,270
They all represent those summer memories.

512
00:47:37,740 --> 00:47:41,040
Then one day, my fans started flooding my dm with messages.

513
00:47:45,930 --> 00:47:51,670
"Shan, you need to check this out! A writer named Little Prince is copying your short story in ‘Deception!’"

514
00:47:51,930 --> 00:47:54,600
This is too identical. It’s clearly plagiarism!

515
00:47:54,630 --> 00:47:58,370
Did he think he could just change to an ancient genre and we wouldn’t notice?

516
00:47:58,770 --> 00:48:01,700
Plagiarism is a serious accusation.

517
00:48:02,370 --> 00:48:06,300
At first, I spent time looking through the comparison lists that the fans had compiled.

518
00:48:20,670 --> 00:48:22,000
Ob-aun!

519
00:48:22,670 --> 00:48:24,240
So that’s how it is.

520
00:48:24,640 --> 00:48:30,140
And then you two met again at the annual YS meeting, right?

521
00:48:32,400 --> 00:48:35,740
Actually, I met Ob-aun before that.

522
00:48:49,370 --> 00:48:51,140
I haven't had a chance to thank you yet.

523
00:48:51,140 --> 00:48:52,240
No problem.

524
00:48:52,700 --> 00:48:54,100
I really need to thank you.

525
00:48:54,540 --> 00:48:56,100
My name's…
Shan!

526
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:58,100
Something wrong?

527
00:48:58,470 --> 00:48:59,340
Nothing.

528
00:49:05,600 --> 00:49:09,400
A YS editor told me Little Prince is Ob-aun’s pen name.

529
00:49:10,240 --> 00:49:12,540
That's how I knew that the cat helper,

530
00:49:12,540 --> 00:49:14,200
the food delivery guy,

531
00:49:15,400 --> 00:49:17,370
and Little Prince of YS …

532
00:49:18,570 --> 00:49:20,100
is Ob-aun.

533
00:49:22,200 --> 00:49:23,840
It’s fate.

534
00:49:25,270 --> 00:49:29,070
So I transferred to YS just to meet Ob-aun again.

535
00:49:31,400 --> 00:49:33,800
I wonder if Ob-aun has forgotten about this older brother.

536
00:49:34,430 --> 00:49:38,600
And I was worried he’d be upset about the misunderstanding.

537
00:49:38,700 --> 00:49:41,070
Ob-aun, over here!

538
00:49:41,340 --> 00:49:45,270
Ozone, I’ve been looking everywhere for you! Why didn’t you text me?

539
00:49:45,540 --> 00:49:47,140
Come on, let’s go.

540
00:49:52,040 --> 00:49:54,500
I used to imagine what he looked like a lot.

541
00:49:55,600 --> 00:50:00,840
But when I finally saw him, I realized he was exactly like my mom described.

542
00:50:01,500 --> 00:50:03,440
Ob-aun is like a little deer.

543
00:50:04,570 --> 00:50:07,840
Ten years … you’re pretty patient, huh?

544
00:50:09,100 --> 00:50:12,470
You could just tell Ob-aun about this.

545
00:50:12,840 --> 00:50:15,170
I’m sure he’ll be touched.

546
00:50:19,500 --> 00:50:24,400
I remember, so it doesn’t matter if Ob-aun has forgotten.

547
00:50:26,100 --> 00:50:31,300
Actually … I met Ob-aun first, then fell in love.

548
00:50:32,840 --> 00:50:35,670
Even if it’s mixed with a bit of those childhood feelings.

549
00:50:41,240 --> 00:50:45,970
Well, now I’m in on your secret and I can’t talk about it. This is a bit frustrating.

550
00:50:46,540 --> 00:50:48,870
You can tell him. I don’t mind.

551
00:50:49,200 --> 00:50:52,440
No, it’s something you have to tell him by yourself.

552
00:50:52,900 --> 00:50:54,100
Officer.

553
00:51:01,270 --> 00:51:03,800
I think I should head back.

554
00:51:04,400 --> 00:51:07,870
It took ten years to meet again, so quickly tell him how you feel.

555
00:51:07,870 --> 00:51:09,500
Before he disappears again.

556
00:51:40,200 --> 00:51:46,200
Director
Nathawat Piyanonpong

557
00:51:46,830 --> 00:51:48,800
I’m Sin. What's your name?

558
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:50,770
I'm Jingjang.
I’m jingjang too.

559
00:51:50,770 --> 00:51:52,270
(Jingjang means “serious” in Thai.)

560
00:51:52,270 --> 00:51:53,900
Why did you come in the monsoon season?

561
00:51:53,900 --> 00:51:55,470
To find inspiration.

562
00:51:55,630 --> 00:51:58,300
There's going to be a boat parade soon. Want to go with me?

563
00:51:58,300 --> 00:51:59,870
You want me to come with you?

564
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:02,800
What was your last wish?

565
00:52:02,800 --> 00:52:04,800
Listen with your heart and you’ll see.

566
00:52:05,200 --> 00:52:06,600
Let's eat out.

567
00:52:06,600 --> 00:52:10,100
Ob-aun, I like you. Can you be my boyfriend?

568
00:52:10,730 --> 00:52:13,430
I might not be the person you remember anymore.
