12
00:01:21,470 --> 00:01:25,550
That’s enough, you’ve had too much.

13
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:28,520
I’m not that drunk.

14
00:01:30,470 --> 00:01:32,640
I just can’t see your eyes clearly.

15
00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:39,410
If you can’t see me, just hold me.

16
00:01:51,550 --> 00:01:53,039
You smell good.

17
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:56,009
Did you put on cologne?

18
00:01:59,039 --> 00:02:00,440
No.

19
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:04,610
I haven’t worn any in a while because you don’t like it.

20
00:02:07,010 --> 00:02:08,750
But I know what it is.

21
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:15,580
What is it?

22
00:02:22,410 --> 00:02:27,520
Phe… ro… mones.

23
00:02:36,930 --> 00:02:38,810
What is pheromone?

24
00:07:01,180 --> 00:07:02,560
Demon Lord.

25
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:05,580
Don’t come any closer.

26
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:29,700
Good boy.

27
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:33,610
Don’t sleep just yet.

28
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:38,130
You should change first.

29
00:08:01,470 --> 00:08:03,270
You should change too.

30
00:10:22,610 --> 00:10:25,510
Ozone. Do you hear me?

31
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:28,380
We’ll be having breakfast at 7 a.m.

32
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:34,360
Huh? What did you say?

33
00:10:59,020 --> 00:11:00,790
Something stuck in your throat?

34
00:11:00,790 --> 00:11:05,590
Is there something between You and Pie?

35
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:10,520
Why are you teasing me? Target Ob-aun and Shan instead.

36
00:11:13,060 --> 00:11:15,820
Everyone knows Ob-aun and I are together.

37
00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:17,960
Not like you and Pie.

38
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:23,020
Well … I was waiting for the right moment to tell you.

39
00:11:24,020 --> 00:11:26,820
Sin, are you jealous of us?

40
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:28,260
Yes.

41
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:40,960
When will The Villain's Strategy Guide end?

42
00:11:41,790 --> 00:11:45,620
Soon. From our schedule, it’ll be done next week.

43
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:48,990
Can you finish it sooner?

44
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:51,490
Why?

45
00:11:53,390 --> 00:11:58,460
Because fans are starting to guess that you guys are the 5yes of Wonder.

46
00:11:59,020 --> 00:12:02,560
Let them guess. We are what we are.

47
00:12:03,290 --> 00:12:05,020
No.

48
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:08,860
You need to start planning.

49
00:12:09,460 --> 00:12:14,590
In half a month, there’s going to be a press conference for YS’ One Story of Moments in Time.

50
00:12:15,620 --> 00:12:17,320
At the convention center.

51
00:12:17,990 --> 00:12:21,090
This time, the 5yes of Wonder will be our highlight.

52
00:12:21,090 --> 00:12:22,690
What?

53
00:12:50,490 --> 00:12:54,770
Would it be strange if I tell you today,

54
00:12:55,070 --> 00:12:59,490
I’m just afraid you might not feel this way.

55
00:12:59,670 --> 00:13:03,190
There’s something my heart desire,

56
00:13:03,190 --> 00:13:08,790
that I want us to stay like this every day.

57
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:28,990
May I ask you not to go so soon?

58
00:13:29,290 --> 00:13:32,340
I really love being close to you.

59
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:38,420
Please stay with me and talk for a while.

60
00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:44,740
Just the two of us, it feels so right.

61
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:21,200
This guy …

62
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:24,500
is my boyfriend.

63
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:32,680
His name is Jingjang.

64
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:36,820
You didn’t tell us about this.

65
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:38,380
Yeah.

66
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:47,280
The press conference starts at 3 p.m.

67
00:14:47,580 --> 00:14:53,150
The live event this time is for charity.

68
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:56,700
Wait, isn’t our debut the main focus?

69
00:15:00,340 --> 00:15:03,160
You can’t sing, can’t dance.

70
00:15:04,180 --> 00:15:05,360
What debut do you want?

71
00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:07,460
Hey!

72
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:09,840
What is this project then?

73
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:12,560
I expanded the project a little.

74
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:16,220
I intend for it to be for charity.

75
00:15:16,220 --> 00:15:21,240
First, I’ll release a special gift set of The Villain’s Strategy Guide,

76
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:23,300
and all the earnings will be donated.

77
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,700
And once we gather enough stories for the project,

78
00:15:28,180 --> 00:15:29,960
we’ll sell the rights.

79
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:34,040
Then, a portion of the earnings will go to charity.

80
00:15:35,660 --> 00:15:38,440
Whoa, can we really do that?

81
00:15:39,060 --> 00:15:42,160
If so, the 5yes of Wonder. …

82
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:46,360
will become a legendary name in the BL novel world.

83
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:47,860
Right?

84
00:15:52,380 --> 00:15:53,960
Okay, it’s almost time.

85
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:55,540
Everyone, get ready.

86
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:12,880
Welcome everyone to the press conference for ...

87
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:15,440
One Story of Moments in Time.

88
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:20,580
Today, we’ll meet five charming writers who’ll answer your questions.

89
00:16:20,580 --> 00:16:22,280
Let’s begin with …

90
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:26,980
Ozone, the person who always keeps the 5yes of Wonder lively and fun.

91
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:38,980
Next, we have the brains of the gang, Jao Samut.

92
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:49,880
And Sin, the laid-back guy who writes spiritual cultivation novels.

93
00:16:59,580 --> 00:17:02,840
The last ones are Ob-aun, a writer of martial arts genre,

94
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:06,960
and Shan, a writer specializing in mystery.

95
00:17:22,060 --> 00:17:25,700
It's like we’re celebrating after passing a game stage.

96
00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:29,430
But there’s one more stage left.

97
00:17:30,230 --> 00:17:31,460
What is it?

98
00:17:32,630 --> 00:17:34,460
I’ll keep that a surprise for now.

99
00:17:35,630 --> 00:17:39,230
Let’s play a game. An easy one.

100
00:17:39,230 --> 00:17:43,630
You’re all familiar with this word, it’s ‘read’.

101
00:17:43,630 --> 00:17:49,080
We’ll have our writers read comments from their fans.

102
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:52,460
Let’s start with Jao Samut.

103
00:18:01,570 --> 00:18:07,480
“P’Jao Samut is the best. I’ll support you forever.”

104
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:08,920
Thank you.

105
00:18:09,460 --> 00:18:11,060
My turn.

106
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:25,080
“I’m afraid my New Year’s blessing will get lost in the flood of messages,

107
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:30,430
and the fireworks will drown out my best wishes for you.”

108
00:18:30,430 --> 00:18:32,480
“P’Ozone, Happy New Year.”

109
00:18:37,860 --> 00:18:39,680
Next, it’s Sin’s turn.

110
00:18:52,660 --> 00:18:55,800
“I’m proud to see you on the stage that’s truly yours.”

111
00:18:57,570 --> 00:18:59,630
“Congratulations.”

112
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:15,060
Now, we’ll have Shan.

113
00:19:15,060 --> 00:19:17,970
But let’s change the rules a bit.

114
00:19:17,970 --> 00:19:22,970
You can either read a fan comment or tell us about your novel.

115
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:24,800
I’ll talk about my novel.

116
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:26,030
Sure thing.

117
00:19:26,030 --> 00:19:31,710
So, The Villain’s Strategy Guide has technically ended,

118
00:19:31,710 --> 00:19:35,370
but many people don’t want it to stop,

119
00:19:35,370 --> 00:19:38,310
so I wrote a spin-off set in modern times,

120
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:45,060
telling what Shen An and Duan Ru Xing would do in our world.

121
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:58,060
This special chapter hasn’t been uploaded yet,

122
00:19:58,060 --> 00:20:02,460
but a staff member asked me about it just now, so I posted a short teaser.

123
00:20:08,170 --> 00:20:12,860
Now I need someone to act in it with me.

124
00:20:15,710 --> 00:20:20,260
Ob-aun. Can you help me out?

125
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:29,600
All you have to do is stand there.

126
00:20:45,540 --> 00:20:48,830
“I’ve kept the music of wedding bells,

127
00:20:52,060 --> 00:20:56,310
I’ve saved the kiss on lips so well.

128
00:20:56,830 --> 00:21:01,080
I’ve caught the stars in your tender gaze,

129
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:08,080
And always treasure the day we met,

130
00:21:09,570 --> 00:21:13,680
With brushstrokes linking heart to heart,

131
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:19,370
We painted our love like a timeless art.

132
00:21:20,340 --> 00:21:23,230
In every tale, you’re by my side,

133
00:21:23,660 --> 00:21:28,600
A bond forever, it feels so right,

134
00:21:29,230 --> 00:21:33,080
We watch the sun, just you and I,

135
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:38,600
Until the moon lights up the sky.”

136
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:51,430
What a great confession!

137
00:21:51,430 --> 00:21:55,800
But the special chapter isn’t out yet, please stay tuned.

138
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:59,370
For now, our game isn’t over. Ob-aun, you’re next.

139
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:16,940
Can I talk about my novel?

140
00:22:16,940 --> 00:22:18,110
Of course.

141
00:22:20,570 --> 00:22:24,340
Originally, we wrote this book

142
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:27,830
just to relax at first,

143
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:32,370
but while writing, it became more than just words.

144
00:22:32,940 --> 00:22:40,970
This novel is filled with sounds, images, feelings of joy and sorrow,

145
00:22:41,260 --> 00:22:44,370
and reflects the dreams and struggles of many people.

146
00:22:44,710 --> 00:22:49,600
It brought us all together between the lines.

147
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:51,910
And I think it’s very romantic.

148
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:55,400
We’ll love you forever, Little Prince.

149
00:22:56,910 --> 00:23:02,280
I’m suddenly thinking about the ending of The Villain’s Strategy Guide,

150
00:23:02,740 --> 00:23:09,310
where Shen An asks Duan Ru Xing …

151
00:23:10,030 --> 00:23:14,230
“Duan Ru Xing, do you like this world?”

152
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:20,060
“The moon shines bright, the breeze runs pure,

153
00:23:20,060 --> 00:23:23,740
Lively crowds, and beasts obscure.

154
00:23:23,740 --> 00:23:27,680
Love, hate, and separation.

155
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:32,480
All from the pen of an ordinary person.

156
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:36,370
Is it real, or just a scene?

157
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:39,430
It feels like wandering through a dream.”

158
00:23:52,170 --> 00:23:56,600
Duan Ru Xing, do you like this world?

159
00:24:25,540 --> 00:24:27,710
I like the world with you in it.

160
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:40,140
I see you’re the reason my smile unfolds.

161
00:24:40,140 --> 00:24:47,200
I’m so lucky to have found you.

162
00:24:49,570 --> 00:24:50,630
Yes.

163
00:24:51,340 --> 00:24:53,430
I like the world with you in it.

164
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:49,680
Red envelopes give away.

165
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:51,680
Huh? What is this?

166
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:54,910
Don’t ask! Just grab it quickly!

167
00:25:54,940 --> 00:25:56,060
Okay.

168
00:25:57,660 --> 00:25:59,110
Thank you, boss.

169
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:03,630
But why isn’t Ob-aun in this group?

170
00:26:07,630 --> 00:26:09,680
I need your help, guys.

171
00:26:10,660 --> 00:26:12,540
I’m going to propose to Ob-aun.

172
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:17,000
Any good ideas?

173
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,310
Really?

174
00:26:19,660 --> 00:26:21,900
Welcome to the Devoted Husbands’ Club.

175
00:26:23,310 --> 00:26:27,280
I used to want to be a wedding designer.

176
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:29,630
Hold on.

177
00:26:29,630 --> 00:26:33,910
Shan, are you sure you want ideas from us?

178
00:26:35,910 --> 00:26:39,770
You want to see Ob-aun float with happiness when you propose, right?

179
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:46,140
From my experience, you’ve already prepared something special.

180
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:48,460
The ring’s ready.

181
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:54,910
Everything’s ready. Then you just need Ob-aun to agree.

182
00:26:56,250 --> 00:27:00,750
How about a candlelight dinner, and the last dish is the ring?

183
00:27:02,260 --> 00:27:06,460
P’Jao Samut, it’s 2024!

184
00:27:08,370 --> 00:27:13,770
We could rent a big villa that’s perfect for hide-and-seek.

185
00:27:13,770 --> 00:27:18,740
Then hide the ring, and give clues to Ob-aun to find it.

186
00:27:21,110 --> 00:27:26,370
Good idea, but if the clues are too easy, it won’t be fun.

187
00:27:26,370 --> 00:27:30,170
And if they’re too hard, Ob-aun won’t find the ring.

188
00:27:31,150 --> 00:27:35,200
Will Shan be walking beside Ob-aun the whole time he looks for the ring?

189
00:27:42,510 --> 00:27:44,920
Guys, I need your help.

190
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:46,200
It’s urgent.
(For Shan (4))

191
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:47,260
What’s going on?
(For Shan (4))

192
00:27:47,260 --> 00:27:48,370
What happened?

193
00:27:48,370 --> 00:27:49,680
Shan isn't here.

194
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:51,880
Yes, don’t add him.

195
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:55,280
Shan’s birthday is coming up, so I want to surprise him. Any ideas?

196
00:27:56,260 --> 00:28:01,140
Ob-aun, I’ve got something to deal with. I’ll be back in 15 minutes.

197
00:28:01,140 --> 00:28:02,710
Sure, no problem.

198
00:28:05,110 --> 00:28:08,940
What a crazy day! They just kept showering their love!

199
00:28:09,970 --> 00:28:13,140
Thanks for inviting me in, what do you want to say?

200
00:28:14,060 --> 00:28:17,230
Shall we discuss what to do next?

201
00:28:17,230 --> 00:28:20,880
Should we tell one that the other is planning something?

202
00:28:21,370 --> 00:28:23,340
Or should we just tell Ob-aun?

203
00:28:23,340 --> 00:28:28,000
But this is the first time Shan’s ever asked us for help.

204
00:28:28,510 --> 00:28:33,680
Maybe we should let him owe us one.

205
00:28:34,510 --> 00:28:35,630
That’s true.

206
00:28:35,630 --> 00:28:40,910
Or should we tell Shan that Ob-aun is planning a surprise.

207
00:28:41,170 --> 00:28:43,940
No way, Ob-aun is our friend.

208
00:28:43,940 --> 00:28:46,600
We can’t betray him.

209
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:47,770
That’s right.

210
00:28:47,770 --> 00:28:50,630
Looks like we’ll have to be double agents.

211
00:28:52,540 --> 00:28:56,480
Are we really going to endure watching them being all sweet?

212
00:28:57,940 --> 00:29:01,480
No other choice, so that’s the plan.

213
00:29:02,910 --> 00:29:04,200
Alright.

214
00:29:05,420 --> 00:29:07,270
(Wedding Planner (3))

215
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:09,970
(Proposal Planning 1 (4))

216
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:11,830
(Proposal Planning 2 (4))

217
00:29:11,830 --> 00:29:15,570
What’s with number 2? There was a group before this one?

218
00:29:17,030 --> 00:29:18,800
Two is …

219
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:23,200
It represents couples. A pair.

220
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:25,030
It’s a good sign.

221
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:29,120
Thanks.

222
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:45,770
Let’s look at the gifts I received.

223
00:29:45,770 --> 00:29:47,170
Sure.

224
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:55,230
I’ll start with Ozone’s.

225
00:29:57,250 --> 00:30:02,140
Happy birthday, Ob-aun. This book is famous.

226
00:30:02,140 --> 00:30:05,150
It has ten chapters, and I chose it just for you.

227
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:10,420
It’s beautifully written, and I even added my own comments.

228
00:30:10,900 --> 00:30:13,370
Spring Wind and Rain.

229
00:30:13,620 --> 00:30:19,200
This chapter helps unlock new feelings between you two.

230
00:30:19,670 --> 00:30:25,770
Marriage Contract, this chapter is amazing, and there’s twins!

231
00:30:28,860 --> 00:30:31,050
Sin’s gift is next.

232
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:53,340
Well, let’s see P’Jao Samut’s gift.

233
00:30:53,340 --> 00:30:56,200
I bet it’s different from these two.

234
00:30:56,510 --> 00:30:58,680
What do you think it is?

235
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:05,370
A painting?

236
00:31:06,260 --> 00:31:08,510
That’s possible.

237
00:31:21,260 --> 00:31:22,740
You’re right.

238
00:31:22,740 --> 00:31:28,050
Heaven rewards those who work hard. From Jao Samut.

239
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:52,660
Pack your things.

240
00:31:54,370 --> 00:31:56,200
Where are you taking me so early?

241
00:31:58,080 --> 00:31:59,230
It’s a secret.

242
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:03,230
Come on, stop playing games for now.

243
00:32:04,230 --> 00:32:06,430
You can get back to it later.

244
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:10,260
Don’t sulk. Let’s go.

245
00:32:12,570 --> 00:32:14,110
Come on.

246
00:32:21,110 --> 00:32:22,940
Let go first.

247
00:33:57,940 --> 00:33:58,920
Who’s that?

248
00:33:58,920 --> 00:34:02,570
My name is Ob-aun, can I come back to play with him tomorrow?

249
00:34:02,570 --> 00:34:04,370
Oh, sure. You’re welcome.

250
00:34:04,370 --> 00:34:08,830
Look, they’re butterflies, and over there are trees.

251
00:34:09,719 --> 00:34:11,860
Let’s play tag.

252
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:17,409
I’ll run around you, and when you say stop, you have to find me.

253
00:34:17,830 --> 00:34:19,170
Okay, start.

254
00:34:37,540 --> 00:34:39,280
I want to be a writer.

255
00:34:39,699 --> 00:34:42,920
I’ll write about how you helped the police catch the thief.

256
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:46,969
And send the short story to a magazine.

257
00:34:46,969 --> 00:34:49,320
So everyone will know about your bravery.

258
00:35:07,340 --> 00:35:08,410
This is …

259
00:35:10,430 --> 00:35:12,230
the place we first met.

260
00:36:43,410 --> 00:36:48,080
I’ve tried not to remember everything that happened here.

261
00:36:50,660 --> 00:36:52,500
When I think of this place,

262
00:36:55,100 --> 00:37:00,300
it always brings me back to our childhood.

263
00:37:07,340 --> 00:37:08,300
Shan

264
00:37:12,520 --> 00:37:14,660
If I couldn’t remember,

265
00:37:16,660 --> 00:37:18,120
would you be upset?

266
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:32,790
Not at all.

267
00:37:33,940 --> 00:37:37,990
I’ve told you that those things don’t really matter.

268
00:37:41,190 --> 00:37:42,770
But I’d be sad …

269
00:37:43,340 --> 00:37:44,810
Why would you?

270
00:37:46,390 --> 00:37:48,120
Because I wouldn’t know …

271
00:37:48,860 --> 00:37:54,390
just how good ... that chocolate cake tasted.

272
00:38:03,660 --> 00:38:04,970
If …

273
00:38:06,370 --> 00:38:08,280
If you came here that day and saw me,

274
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:13,700
what would be the first thing you’d say?

275
00:38:15,810 --> 00:38:19,120
P’Shan, where’s my chocolate cake?

276
00:38:32,920 --> 00:38:34,260
Nong Ob-aun …

277
00:39:02,830 --> 00:39:04,920
Our story starts here.

278
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:10,700
And from now on, can I stay by your side for life?

279
00:39:11,140 --> 00:39:17,260
To meet you and stand by your side.

280
00:39:17,260 --> 00:39:23,790
Whatever comes, it's you I'll hold,

281
00:39:23,790 --> 00:39:36,460
I see you’re the reason my smile unfolds.

282
00:39:37,340 --> 00:39:38,260
Yes.

283
00:39:38,430 --> 00:39:43,570
I’m so lucky to have found you.

284
00:39:43,570 --> 00:39:49,540
To meet you and stand by your side.

285
00:39:49,540 --> 00:39:55,990
Whatever comes, it's you I'll hold,

286
00:39:55,990 --> 00:40:07,810
I see you’re the reason my smile unfolds.

287
00:40:07,810 --> 00:40:13,680
I’m so lucky to have found you.

288
00:40:44,070 --> 00:40:51,240
Wow, here they are.

289
00:40:52,070 --> 00:40:53,440
My friend is taken.

290
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:58,920
Congrats!

291
00:40:58,920 --> 00:41:08,570
Kiss! Kiss!

292
00:42:24,190 --> 00:42:25,720
I’m so jealous!
