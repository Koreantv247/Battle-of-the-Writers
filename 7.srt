2
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:32,020
Excuse me, do you have any rooms available?

3
00:00:39,140 --> 00:00:40,060
Yes.

4
00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:52,300
This is the only room left.

5
00:00:53,170 --> 00:00:55,550
Breakfast starts at 7 AM.

6
00:00:55,550 --> 00:00:57,620
And if you need anything,

7
00:00:58,570 --> 00:01:00,450
just come over to my house.

8
00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:03,850
It’s where we met earlier.

9
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:08,000
Oh, can I ask you something?

10
00:01:08,270 --> 00:01:10,000
Why did you come in the monsoon season?

11
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:14,770
To find inspiration.

12
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:19,450
Seeing the sea, the mountains,

13
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:21,970
and the waves in the rain …

14
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:24,750
is such a good vibe.

15
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:27,900
What will you do with that inspiration?

16
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:32,470
I'm a writer.

17
00:01:35,270 --> 00:01:36,420
My name is Sin.

18
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:38,850
What's yours?

19
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:41,450
I'm Jingjang.

20
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:43,670
I'm Jingjang too.

21
00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:45,670
(Jingjang means “serious” in Thai.)

22
00:01:46,170 --> 00:01:48,500
No, my name is Jingjang.

23
00:01:50,550 --> 00:01:52,100
Make yourself at home. I'll be off.

24
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:06,450
Excuse me.

25
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:09,419
Excuse me.

26
00:02:10,970 --> 00:02:11,620
Yes?

27
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:15,850
There's no towel in the room. Could I get one?

28
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:17,070
Sure.

29
00:02:17,570 --> 00:02:18,870
How many would you like?

30
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:22,700
Two, please. And two extra pillows as well.

31
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:23,970
Okay, sure.

32
00:02:24,170 --> 00:02:25,020
Mom.

33
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,970
This is Sin. He’s staying at our homestay.

34
00:02:28,970 --> 00:02:31,950
He didn't have any towels, so he asked for extras.

35
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:34,520
Hello.
Hi there!

36
00:02:34,820 --> 00:02:35,820
Ma'am …

37
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:36,850
Call me mom.

38
00:02:36,850 --> 00:02:37,950
Hello, mom.

39
00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:41,350
You need towels, right? I have plenty. Let me go get some for you.

40
00:02:41,350 --> 00:02:42,970
Thank you so much.

41
00:02:42,970 --> 00:02:44,020
Jingjang, Mom.

42
00:02:44,020 --> 00:02:46,200
What?

43
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:49,070
The bilge pump on the boat is broken. Come help bail out the water quickly!

44
00:02:49,070 --> 00:02:50,750
Okay, okay.

45
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:51,650
You too, please.

46
00:02:51,650 --> 00:02:53,750
Dad, he's a guest! How can you ask him to help?

47
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:56,050
Come on, let's all pitch in. Hurry!

48
00:02:56,050 --> 00:02:59,020
Sorry to trouble you. Please help us.

49
00:02:59,020 --> 00:03:00,100
This way!

50
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:03,920
Why did the pump break now? Come on!

51
00:03:06,550 --> 00:03:08,000
Bail it outside, not inside!

52
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,670
Outside?
Bail it out of the boat!

53
00:03:09,670 --> 00:03:11,300
Got it. Outside the boat.

54
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:12,720
I'll check on the pump.

55
00:03:13,550 --> 00:03:14,700
Bail it out.

56
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:16,600
Argh!

57
00:03:19,170 --> 00:03:20,950
Hey! You’re getting lazy.

58
00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:21,800
Just keep going!

59
00:03:26,070 --> 00:03:27,620
Dad! Dad!

60
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:28,170
Huh?

61
00:03:28,170 --> 00:03:29,570
The new pump is here!

62
00:03:29,570 --> 00:03:30,800
It’s here?

63
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:33,500
Jingjang, keep bailing the water. I'll go get the pump.

64
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:34,750
Go ahead.

65
00:03:41,450 --> 00:03:44,220
What should we do? It’s like the boat's sinking.

66
00:03:44,470 --> 00:03:47,270
It won't sink, but if we stop bailing, it definitely will!

67
00:03:47,270 --> 00:03:48,850
Okay.

68
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:58,670
The new pump is here, quick!

69
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:20,120

79
00:05:24,650 --> 00:05:25,700
Are you tired?

80
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:29,420
I'm sorry for asking you to do this.

81
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:32,870
How about I cook you some seafood for you?

82
00:05:34,370 --> 00:05:35,320
Sounds good.

83
00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:38,200
I'm so hungry I could eat all the fish in the sea.

84
00:05:39,370 --> 00:05:42,600
You can go catch any fish you want to eat

85
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:45,300
And bring it back to me before it’s late.

86
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:46,720
Yes.
Yes.

87
00:05:48,070 --> 00:05:49,020
I have to catch it?

88
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:51,400
Yeah, Jingjang will teach you.

89
00:05:52,150 --> 00:05:52,950
He's good at it.

90
00:05:55,370 --> 00:05:56,620
You will be fine, let's go.

91
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:58,150
Are we for real?

92
00:05:59,000 --> 00:05:59,870
Which pond is it?

93
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:01,720
Which one?

94
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:03,220
This one?

95
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,500
Should I go down there?
Watch out!

96
00:06:05,970 --> 00:06:07,500
You can use this one and that one.

97
00:06:07,650 --> 00:06:08,500
This one?

98
00:06:09,270 --> 00:06:10,700
Yeah, right here, you see?
This?

99
00:06:11,170 --> 00:06:13,170
How do we catch them? Whoa, fish, fish!

100
00:06:13,170 --> 00:06:14,350
Can I have this one?

101
00:06:14,350 --> 00:06:15,100
Sure.

102
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:16,470
Do I really have to go in there?

103
00:06:17,050 --> 00:06:19,100
Who would go in? You just do it like this.

104
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:25,900
How? Whoa, there are a lot of them!

105
00:06:26,350 --> 00:06:27,870
The fish scoop is over there.

106
00:06:27,870 --> 00:06:29,100
Huh? Which one?

107
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:30,750
That’s it, the long one.

108
00:06:33,670 --> 00:06:34,850
Grab it in the middle.

109
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:36,700
In the middle? Okay.

110
00:06:36,970 --> 00:06:38,020
Ha!

111
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:41,870
Sorry.

112
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:43,370
Are you ready?

113
00:06:44,020 --> 00:06:45,250
I'll lift, then you catch it.

114
00:06:45,250 --> 00:06:46,800
Sure, let's go.

115
00:06:47,270 --> 00:06:50,700
Little fish, today you're mine.

116
00:06:51,050 --> 00:06:52,620
I'm gonna eat you up.

117
00:07:02,620 --> 00:07:04,670
There's going to be a boat parade soon.

118
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:06,620
Want to go with me?

119
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:11,300
You want me to come with you?

120
00:07:14,650 --> 00:07:15,700
Well ...

121
00:07:16,950 --> 00:07:19,870
Just having a meal with you makes me happy.

122
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:26,900
But it seems like I’ll be busy later on.

123
00:07:27,970 --> 00:07:28,620
Eh?

124
00:07:29,570 --> 00:07:31,070
I have to upload my novel.

125
00:07:31,570 --> 00:07:34,050
But most tourists really love this festival.

126
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:39,250
You really want me to go with you, huh?

127
00:07:42,970 --> 00:07:44,050
Alright, I’ll go.

128
00:08:02,470 --> 00:08:04,150
Ob-aun, have you eaten yet?

129
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:05,950
Shall I make something for you?

130
00:08:12,770 --> 00:08:13,650
Ob-aun.

131
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:20,170
Shan
Are you hungry?

132
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:27,870
No. You go ahead.

133
00:08:40,970 --> 00:08:44,420
I still have some unfinished work, so I’ll continue writing.

134
00:09:02,770 --> 00:09:04,450
Why do we have to carry these logs?

135
00:09:06,250 --> 00:09:09,450
It's the boat festival, our important tradition.

136
00:09:10,670 --> 00:09:12,950
Everyone on the island has to work together

137
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:16,050
and carry the logs to ask the Sky God for blessings.

138
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:20,070
Let's join them.

139
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:18,820
Be gentle please.

140
00:10:23,770 --> 00:10:24,500
Fine.

141
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:27,500
There’s a wishing ceremony tonight.

142
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:32,600
What are you going to make me do next?

143
00:10:35,150 --> 00:10:36,750
We just dance with other villagers.

144
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:40,000
But tourists can join in too.

145
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:44,950
Oh, that’s good to hear.

146
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:47,500
I’m fine with dancing.

147
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:51,770
But no more labor work.

148
00:10:54,650 --> 00:10:59,500
Just a day with you, but it's like I've been exercising for half a year.

149
00:10:59,550 --> 00:11:00,820
I’m exhausted.

150
00:11:02,950 --> 00:11:04,320
My body aches all over.

151
00:11:09,570 --> 00:11:15,000
You don’t look like someone who would do this kind of physical work.

152
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:18,850
Well, I grew up here.

153
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:21,150
I never left this island.

154
00:11:23,070 --> 00:11:25,800
There were no tourists in the past.

155
00:11:27,270 --> 00:11:31,120
So us locals had to do everything ourselves.

156
00:11:32,020 --> 00:11:33,800
I had friends who grew up with me.

157
00:11:34,350 --> 00:11:37,250
But as more tourists came, they all started leaving.

158
00:11:38,450 --> 00:11:40,600
No one stays behind to help preparing things.

159
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:46,650
So, thank you so much for helping us today.

160
00:11:54,020 --> 00:11:54,970
Jingjang.

161
00:11:56,870 --> 00:11:59,320
Have you ever thought about going out to see the world?

162
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:07,120
Like visiting Bangkok or Chiang Mai …

163
00:12:07,250 --> 00:12:08,320
or traveling abroad?

164
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:13,820
I only know how to build boats and catch fish.

165
00:12:14,050 --> 00:12:15,420
Nothing else.

166
00:12:15,420 --> 00:12:16,700
If I left, what would I do?

167
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:21,420
I’m gonna grab more medicine.

168
00:12:22,870 --> 00:12:24,050
Hey, hold on.

169
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:36,300
Ah!

170
00:12:36,570 --> 00:12:41,270
Uh, I brought some medicine for Sin.

171
00:12:41,270 --> 00:12:42,870
I won’t bother you then.

172
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:44,520
Mom, it's not like that.

173
00:12:45,050 --> 00:12:46,720
I'll leave it on the bed.

174
00:13:03,350 --> 00:13:05,170
What kind of medicine did you apply on me?

175
00:13:05,450 --> 00:13:08,000
It feels slippery

176
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:10,750
and has a strange smell.

177
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:14,250
Do you know sea cockroaches?

178
00:13:14,250 --> 00:13:14,900
What?

179
00:13:15,070 --> 00:13:16,400
They’re a local specialty here.

180
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:17,370
Cockroaches?

181
00:13:17,370 --> 00:13:21,350
Yeah, they help with muscle aches and injuries,

182
00:13:21,350 --> 00:13:24,350
especially around the waist.
Arghhh!

183
00:13:25,850 --> 00:13:27,650
Why? It’s just a cockroach.

184
00:13:27,650 --> 00:13:29,800
Are you scared?

185
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:30,870
Hey!

186
00:13:37,870 --> 00:13:38,650
Ob-aun.

187
00:13:45,220 --> 00:13:47,250
I want to talk to you.

188
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:51,870
I haven’t finished writing my draft, let me get back to it.

189
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:13,680
The wishing festival is really crowded.

190
00:15:14,770 --> 00:15:18,470
So if you want the Sky God to hear you, make your wish quickly.

191
00:15:24,020 --> 00:15:26,320
I wish for peace on the island.

192
00:15:26,650 --> 00:15:28,820
I wish for good health for my parents.

193
00:15:30,650 --> 00:15:31,750
I wish for...

194
00:15:43,670 --> 00:15:44,750
Hey.

195
00:15:45,950 --> 00:15:48,500
What was your last wish?

196
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:52,050
If you whisper like that, the Sky God won’t hear you.

197
00:15:56,050 --> 00:15:58,000
Try listening with your heart.

198
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:00,920
The Sky God will definitely hear it.

199
00:16:01,870 --> 00:16:03,300
Because my last wish ...

200
00:16:05,470 --> 00:16:06,600
is right here.

201
00:16:33,770 --> 00:16:34,720
Jingjang.

202
00:16:39,450 --> 00:16:40,720
Have you ever kissed someone?

203
00:16:41,050 --> 00:16:41,870
Huh?

204
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:45,020
What did you say?

205
00:16:47,020 --> 00:16:49,250
I asked if you’ve ever kissed ...

206
00:16:51,170 --> 00:16:55,450
Would it be strange if I tell you today,

207
00:16:55,750 --> 00:17:00,170
I’m just afraid you might not feel this way.

208
00:17:00,350 --> 00:17:03,870
There’s something my heart desire,

209
00:17:03,870 --> 00:17:08,849
that I want us to stay like this every day.

210
00:17:08,869 --> 00:17:10,020
Never before.

211
00:17:11,819 --> 00:17:12,920
But I have now.

212
00:17:14,470 --> 00:17:19,819
May I ask you not to go so soon?

213
00:17:20,119 --> 00:17:23,170
I really love being close to you.

214
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:29,250
Please stay with me and talk for a while.

215
00:17:29,250 --> 00:17:35,570
Just the two of us, it feels so right.

216
00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:11,350
Hey, I …

217
00:18:11,350 --> 00:18:12,900
I was just about to call you.

218
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:15,170
Huh? What’s up?

219
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:18,070
I have a situation.

220
00:18:20,270 --> 00:18:21,170
What happened?

221
00:18:22,970 --> 00:18:24,770
He’s got a new guy to be paired with.

222
00:18:28,670 --> 00:18:31,350
Are you alright?

223
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:35,400
It’s fine, but ... How do I explain this to you?

224
00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:37,170
I think I’m supposed to feel sad.

225
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:42,220
It’s okay to be sad, you know?

226
00:18:43,170 --> 00:18:43,820
No.

227
00:18:44,620 --> 00:18:48,220
You don’t understand. The thing is, I don’t feel anything at all.

228
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:52,320
You don’t feel anything?

229
00:18:53,050 --> 00:18:53,900
Yeah.

230
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:58,170
Then …

231
00:18:58,650 --> 00:19:01,000
You need to ask yourself how you’re feeling right now.

232
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:03,170
You mean whether I like Min or not?

233
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:05,570
No, I mean ...

234
00:19:05,850 --> 00:19:10,170
You need to listen to your heart and find out what you truly feel.

235
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:15,100
Ob-aun, you’ve really grown up.

236
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:22,770
I have to go now.

237
00:19:40,050 --> 00:19:41,400
Let’s eat out.

238
00:20:36,550 --> 00:20:40,870
Ob-aun, could you please stop avoiding me?

239
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:45,570
I’m not avoiding you.

240
00:20:47,900 --> 00:20:49,650
I’ve just been working on a new novel.

241
00:20:54,270 --> 00:20:55,850
What’s it about?

242
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:59,870
A detective fiction.

243
00:21:01,170 --> 00:21:03,070
Detective, huh?

244
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:07,270
Are you thinking of trying out new genres? I’m pretty good at that.

245
00:21:10,220 --> 00:21:12,420
The main character is a police officer named Shan.

246
00:21:16,150 --> 00:21:17,020
Shan.

247
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:21,100
Can I write about you in my novel?

248
00:21:27,270 --> 00:21:31,750
Now I’m in on your secret and I can’t talk about it. This is a bit frustrating.

249
00:21:32,650 --> 00:21:34,950
You can tell him. I don’t mind.

250
00:21:35,250 --> 00:21:38,420
No, it’s something you have to tell him by yourself.

251
00:21:38,950 --> 00:21:40,000
Officer.

252
00:22:04,470 --> 00:22:05,820
Ob-aun, I’m leaving.

253
00:22:07,050 --> 00:22:11,400
When you were talking to Ozone that day, I heard everything.

254
00:22:12,670 --> 00:22:14,500
I might have forgotten many things

255
00:22:17,220 --> 00:22:18,770
But I didn’t mean to forget.

256
00:22:20,650 --> 00:22:22,500
I’m not perfect like Lin Song Yue,

257
00:22:23,220 --> 00:22:24,670
not as skilled as Duan Ru Xing.

258
00:22:26,150 --> 00:22:28,100
and not as cute as Shan Yao.

259
00:22:29,370 --> 00:22:31,070
I’m not like how you imagine.

260
00:22:31,950 --> 00:22:33,570
I’m just an ordinary guy.

261
00:22:35,650 --> 00:22:37,200
So if it’s this Ob-aun,

262
00:22:38,670 --> 00:22:41,170
the one who can’t remember things from ten years ago …

263
00:22:43,270 --> 00:22:44,370
Would you still …

264
00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:52,000
Ob-aun.

265
00:22:53,420 --> 00:22:55,720
I like you. Can you be my boyfriend?

266
00:23:18,420 --> 00:23:22,020
If you’re not ready, you don’t have to answer right away.

267
00:23:27,670 --> 00:23:30,550
When I do something, I always prepare in advance

268
00:23:31,420 --> 00:23:33,020
because it makes me feel secure.

269
00:23:34,970 --> 00:23:38,670
But the only thing I’m rushing is you.

270
00:23:39,570 --> 00:23:41,450
I don’t care what happens after this.

271
00:23:42,220 --> 00:23:44,320
I just want to tell you how I feel.

272
00:23:49,950 --> 00:23:52,400
I …
I know you have feelings for me too.

273
00:23:53,300 --> 00:23:56,870
You’re just not sure if those feelings are strong enough to answer me.

274
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:04,820
Actually, the two of us ...

275
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:08,970
We’re not even that close.

276
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:17,000
But it doesn’t matter.

277
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:22,800
Like I said, you don’t have to answer me.

278
00:24:24,470 --> 00:24:25,400
I …

279
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:31,820
I just feel like it’s been so many years already.

280
00:24:32,170 --> 00:24:34,800
I might not be the person you remember anymore.

281
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:38,500
Also, the memories from back then ...

282
00:24:39,820 --> 00:24:41,720
I can barely remember anything.

283
00:24:42,050 --> 00:24:44,000
All that’s left are fragments that confuse me.

284
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,500
I’m afraid ...

285
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:49,450
I might not be as good as you think.

286
00:24:50,170 --> 00:24:52,500
And I might not be the same as in your memories.

287
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:53,570
I know.

288
00:24:55,570 --> 00:24:57,450
Honestly, I’m not as good as you think either.

289
00:24:58,100 --> 00:25:01,770
I kissed the one I like, then chickened out and ran away.

290
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:05,000
I got jealous seeing you with someone else.

291
00:25:05,750 --> 00:25:07,850
And I kept coming up with schemes …

292
00:25:09,100 --> 00:25:10,970
to get closer to you.

293
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,520
That’s who I am.

294
00:25:16,300 --> 00:25:18,250
I’m Shan, who's far from perfect.

295
00:25:20,850 --> 00:25:21,900
But I ...

296
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:23,170
You don’t need to worry.

297
00:25:24,570 --> 00:25:29,420
Nietzsche once said that “There is always some madness in love.”

298
00:25:30,620 --> 00:25:36,070
To love someone is to interpret that person in your own way.

299
00:25:40,950 --> 00:25:43,370
Oh, that line’s from the latest series I watched.

300
00:25:43,820 --> 00:25:47,820
So even God Shan watches series, huh?

301
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:51,170
See?

302
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:55,350
It’s not like I’m in meetings or working every day.

303
00:25:56,400 --> 00:26:01,720
I also watch series, play games, and even sit around doing nothing.

304
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:03,870
So ...

305
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:07,200
What I mean is ...

306
00:26:08,350 --> 00:26:10,770
In my eyes, you’re already good enough.

307
00:26:12,170 --> 00:26:14,620
Don't worry about whether you’re good enough.

308
00:26:15,070 --> 00:26:17,170
Because I’m not perfect either.

309
00:26:22,950 --> 00:26:23,820
Shan.

310
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:27,250
Can you be my boyfriend?

311
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:36,070
As time passes and changes come, you’re the only one who cares for me.

312
00:26:36,070 --> 00:26:40,650
It feels like a dream.

313
00:26:43,970 --> 00:26:49,800
To meet you and stand by your side.

314
00:26:50,020 --> 00:26:56,470
Whatever comes, it's you I'll hold,

315
00:26:56,520 --> 00:27:08,120
I see you’re the reason my smile unfolds.

316
00:27:08,270 --> 00:27:13,900
I’m so lucky to have found you.

317
00:28:43,870 --> 00:28:46,250
Come here, let me dry your hair.

318
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:49,870
I can dry it myself.

319
00:28:51,170 --> 00:28:52,770
Just stay still.

320
00:28:56,170 --> 00:28:57,120
Alright.

321
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:16,050
If you sleep with wet hair, you’ll get sick.

322
00:29:17,970 --> 00:29:19,270
Yeah.

323
00:29:21,950 --> 00:29:22,770
Hey ...

324
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:27,550
Can I sleep in your room tonight?

325
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:37,820
Of course.

326
00:33:17,020 --> 00:33:21,070
It’s the third watch of the night, be mindful of fire.

327
00:33:57,870 --> 00:33:59,000
Shen An.

328
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:01,070
Don’t blame me.

329
00:34:02,150 --> 00:34:04,420
We can't walk on the same path.

330
00:35:58,120 --> 00:36:01,970
You left without a word, but at least I found you.

331
00:36:11,270 --> 00:36:12,270
Shen An.

332
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:15,900
You came here to ask me, didn’t you?

333
00:36:17,870 --> 00:36:19,720
Even injured, you still talk so much.

334
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:22,500
Stay in the cave for now.

335
00:36:26,300 --> 00:36:28,200
You really have no questions for me?

336
00:36:30,620 --> 00:36:31,350
Ouch.

337
00:36:33,750 --> 00:36:36,450
I’ll ask soon. Apply the medicine first.

338
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:47,170
Even if you don’t ask, I don’t want to deceive you anymore.

339
00:36:48,250 --> 00:36:49,770
Or have you figured it out?

340
00:36:51,270 --> 00:36:54,050
That the one who killed your master, Qing Yue  …

341
00:36:56,620 --> 00:36:57,720
was me.

342
00:36:58,300 --> 00:36:59,300
I know.

343
00:37:01,870 --> 00:37:07,350
The one who caused chaos on Mount Bu Zhou, stole the Abyssal blade, and destroyed the seven sects ...

344
00:37:07,900 --> 00:37:09,000
was also me.

345
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:10,020
I know.

346
00:37:13,370 --> 00:37:16,020
Last night, by your bedside,

347
00:37:16,750 --> 00:37:19,850
the one who tried to kill you was me as well.

348
00:37:27,250 --> 00:37:28,300
Are you done?

349
00:37:28,300 --> 00:37:29,200
No.

350
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:33,600
I am the reborn star of calamity, destined to bring disaster to the martial world

351
00:37:33,770 --> 00:37:36,100
and become a threat to all people.

352
00:37:36,300 --> 00:37:39,500
You and I are destined to be enemies,

353
00:37:39,500 --> 00:37:41,820
unable to coexist under the same sky.

354
00:37:46,470 --> 00:37:48,450
Hurry, kill me now.

355
00:37:49,220 --> 00:37:51,920
Take the chance and cut off my head.

356
00:37:53,070 --> 00:37:57,300
Bring it back to your sect, and you'll still be the revered Master Shen.

357
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:25,900
You did kill my master, but it was because he lost control of his internal energy.

358
00:38:26,670 --> 00:38:28,650
You had to help him find peace.

359
00:38:30,770 --> 00:38:36,150
You destroyed the seven sects, only because they attacked first.

360
00:38:36,950 --> 00:38:39,570
Had you not fought back, you'd have been dead for sure.

361
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:44,870
Last night,

362
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:49,050
you wanted to kill me.

363
00:38:53,470 --> 00:38:55,770
But I’m still standing before you, aren’t I?

364
00:39:11,150 --> 00:39:14,600
If everything could be settled with a sword,

365
00:39:15,670 --> 00:39:17,150
that would be ideal.

366
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:19,400
However,

367
00:39:20,300 --> 00:39:22,370
I can’t bring myself to strike.

368
00:39:24,550 --> 00:39:29,620
I’m greedy. Being with you this long is enough for me.

369
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:35,670
Let’s end this and never meet again.

370
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,950
You can’t bring yourself to do it.

371
00:40:12,870 --> 00:40:14,320
Isn’t that right?

372
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:26,850
Shen An.

373
00:40:28,270 --> 00:40:29,670
Let me go.

374
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:34,050
Don’t involve yourself with me anymore.
No.

375
00:40:34,850 --> 00:40:39,300
Even if the whole world sees me as traitorous, deluded and lost,

376
00:40:42,270 --> 00:40:44,850
I’ll stay by your side to the bitter end.

377
00:40:46,420 --> 00:40:49,600
We’ll escape this prison of the mortal realm together.

378
00:41:38,750 --> 00:41:39,820
A-Xing.

379
00:41:43,150 --> 00:41:45,270
Don’t push me away again.

380
00:42:44,820 --> 00:42:47,700
I apologize, Sect Leader! I didn’t see anything!

381
00:42:49,420 --> 00:42:52,720
I just witnessed the righteous master kissing the demon Lord.

382
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:55,750
I can't stay here anymore. They’re going to silence me for sure.

383
00:43:10,870 --> 00:43:11,540
Excuse me.

384
00:43:11,540 --> 00:43:13,690
Not now, I'm annoyed.

385
00:43:16,020 --> 00:43:16,690
Oh.

386
00:43:17,770 --> 00:43:18,420
Oh.

387
00:43:18,420 --> 00:43:19,520
You.
It’s you.

388
00:43:20,920 --> 00:43:22,570
Your new hair color looks nice.

389
00:43:23,020 --> 00:43:25,270
So, why are you here?

390
00:43:26,320 --> 00:43:30,520
Well, I got kicked out for reading too much.

391
00:43:30,520 --> 00:43:32,340
But it’s nice working here.

392
00:43:32,840 --> 00:43:34,020
It’s not hot.

393
00:43:34,620 --> 00:43:36,440
Are you still reading the same novel?

394
00:43:36,840 --> 00:43:38,920
Yeah, that one.

395
00:43:39,420 --> 00:43:42,470
But I don’t get why Lian’er exists. He's so annoying.

396
00:43:47,270 --> 00:43:48,690
So, what do you want to order?

397
00:43:54,070 --> 00:43:57,090
No, nothing. I’ll be going now.

398
00:44:01,140 --> 00:44:01,920
Sis.

399
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:02,540
Yes?

400
00:44:02,790 --> 00:44:05,670
Don’t read too much or you’ll get kicked out again.

401
00:44:06,820 --> 00:44:08,690
Hey, this kid …

402
00:44:08,840 --> 00:44:10,570
He’s as annoying as Lian’er.

403
00:44:12,550 --> 00:44:18,020
I just finished the new chapter. Please tell me when Lian'er is going to disappear.

404
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:24,470
It’s so frustrating. Shen An and Duan Ru Xing finally got on the same page,

405
00:44:24,470 --> 00:44:28,900
but he completely ruined the long-awaited kiss scene.

406
00:44:29,020 --> 00:44:31,720
What’s going on? I haven’t read the new chapter yet.

407
00:44:32,490 --> 00:44:36,670
Dang it! This character went from being Shen An’s servant …

408
00:44:36,670 --> 00:44:40,070
to someone acting like his and Duan Ru Xing’s mom.

409
00:44:40,070 --> 00:44:42,720
What does Shen An’s love life have to do with him?

410
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:45,170
Why add such a stupid scene?

411
00:44:45,820 --> 00:44:48,340
The writer must be too attached to this character.

412
00:44:48,340 --> 00:44:51,000
I think it’s okay. It might be illological,

413
00:44:51,020 --> 00:44:52,600
but he works as a side character.

414
00:44:52,600 --> 00:44:58,600
But this side character keeps worrying about Shen An and Duan Ru Xing getting caught,

415
00:44:58,620 --> 00:45:01,870
criticizing Shen An for mistreating Duan Ru Xing,

416
00:45:01,870 --> 00:45:05,900
thinking there are too many obstacles between them, and they won’t last.

417
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:07,850
Bro, you’re just an outsider.

418
00:45:07,850 --> 00:45:12,320
I’ve been annoyed by him since last week, and when I thought he finally disappeared,

419
00:45:12,330 --> 00:45:14,500
he showed up again this week.

420
00:45:15,870 --> 00:45:18,370
The chapter has gone off track with this character.

421
00:45:18,420 --> 00:45:20,400
They built up the supporting character well,

422
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:22,520
only to ruin it with some random nonsense.

423
00:45:22,520 --> 00:45:25,950
It’s weird and pointless, just like Lian’er.

424
00:45:25,970 --> 00:45:28,100
Those who know understand he’s a side character.

425
00:45:28,150 --> 00:45:31,200
Those who don’t will think he’s a random evil guy.

426
00:45:31,220 --> 00:45:33,320
He’s a wicked father-in-law.

427
00:45:33,370 --> 00:45:35,700
Just like the writer, then.

428
00:45:35,750 --> 00:45:40,550
I don’t like him either, but saying he is like the writer might be too much.

429
00:45:41,720 --> 00:45:43,470
If this were a series,

430
00:45:43,500 --> 00:45:47,820
the actor playing him definitely paid to get more scenes.

431
00:45:48,170 --> 00:45:52,370
Calm down. We read novels for fun. If you don’t like it, just stop reading.

432
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:54,700
Don’t vent in the comments section.

433
00:45:56,050 --> 00:45:57,850
Hold on, who are you, bro?

434
00:45:57,850 --> 00:45:59,970
Why are you always defending the writer?

435
00:46:01,750 --> 00:46:03,870
I’ve thought you’re sus for a while.

436
00:46:04,600 --> 00:46:07,370
Don’t tell me this is a side account of the writer.

437
00:46:07,420 --> 00:46:10,720
Everyone, gather around! Let’s expose this account.

438
00:46:10,920 --> 00:46:12,900
I’m ready to go.

439
00:46:12,920 --> 00:46:15,220
Wait, where did that account go?

440
00:46:20,720 --> 00:46:22,320
Lucky I got out in time.

441
00:46:22,470 --> 00:46:24,640
I almost got exposed.

442
00:46:27,970 --> 00:46:29,720
My side account nearly got caught.

443
00:46:30,870 --> 00:46:31,920
Lian’er.

444
00:46:32,790 --> 00:46:37,240
Yeah, who would’ve thought the comments section would blow up because of Lian’er?

445
00:46:37,990 --> 00:46:41,970
Ozone, how many plotlines did you plan out? Tell me.

446
00:46:44,040 --> 00:46:47,020
Ozone, what’s the deal with Lian’er?

447
00:46:47,670 --> 00:46:49,990
He had a lot of scenes already.

448
00:46:50,540 --> 00:46:52,500
Why’d you write more?

449
00:46:53,740 --> 00:46:54,940
Well, I ...

450
00:47:00,020 --> 00:47:03,800
I’m suffering, but I can’t say anything.

451
00:47:04,200 --> 00:47:08,100
Lian’er is me. I am Lian’er.

452
00:47:08,470 --> 00:47:12,450
I found out a secret a few days ago, but I can’t tell anyone.

453
00:47:12,450 --> 00:47:17,920
It’s killing me, so I vented by writing it into the story.

454
00:47:18,520 --> 00:47:21,720
That’s why I created a character full of worries.

455
00:47:22,770 --> 00:47:27,370
If Lian’er is Shen An and Duan Ru Xing’s evil father-in-law,

456
00:47:28,400 --> 00:47:33,450
then I’m probably the godmother of God Shan and Little Ob-aun.

457
00:47:40,320 --> 00:47:44,150
I really went off-topic with this one. P’Jao Samut, can you wrap up for me again?

458
00:47:44,320 --> 00:47:46,070
He’s not relevant to the plot anymore.

459
00:47:46,500 --> 00:47:47,400
Okay.

460
00:47:48,270 --> 00:47:52,200
By the way, when is Shan going to write the intimate scene?

461
00:47:57,600 --> 00:48:00,900
Believe in Master Si Er Ye. It might be soon.

462
00:48:01,150 --> 00:48:02,170
Right?

463
00:48:04,550 --> 00:48:06,300
Yeah, very soon.

464
00:48:12,700 --> 00:48:15,850
I can’t take it anymore. I’m about to lose my mind!

465
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:20,920
I need to vent somewhere else, not the novel again.

466
00:48:21,020 --> 00:48:24,220
I can’t post something on Instagram either.

467
00:48:24,300 --> 00:48:27,900
I don’t feel comfortable sharing it with anyone outside the group.

468
00:48:28,200 --> 00:48:32,120
And talking to close friends feels like gossiping behind his back.

469
00:48:32,470 --> 00:48:35,280
Wait, there is someone who’s perfect for this.
